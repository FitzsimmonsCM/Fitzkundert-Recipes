Ingredients
===========
- 1 cup (5 ounces; 140g) medium or coarse cornmeal/polenta [1]
- 5 cups (1.2L) water, milk, or chicken/vegetable stock [2]
- salt
- 2 tablespoons (1 ounce; 30g) unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil

Recipe
======
1. If Using the Presoaking Method: Combine water with cornmeal in a large 
   mixing bowl and let stand, covered, at room temperature overnight. When 
   ready to cook, scrape soaked cornmeal and water into a large saucier or 
   saucepan and set over high heat. Continue with step 3.

2. If Using the Standard Method: Add water, milk, or stock to a large saucier 
   or saucepan and set over high heat. Sprinkle in cornmeal while whisking 
   (water does not have to be boiling).

3. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Continue until polenta thickens enough 
   that it starts to spit. Lower heat immediately to prevent spitting and 
   continue to cook, stirring frequently with a spoon or silicone spatula and 
   scraping bottom to prevent scorching, until polenta becomes thick and pulls 
   away from side of saucepan, about 30 minutes for presoaked cornmeal and 50 
   minutes for dry cornmeal. Season with salt.

4. Stir in butter or olive oil, using either a spoon, a silicone spatula, or a 
   whisk. If polenta forms lumps, beat vigorously with a stiff whisk to remove. 
   If polenta becomes too firm or begins to set, add a small amount of water, 
   stock, or milk and beat in with a whisk until liquid is fully incorporated 
   and no lumps remain.

5. Serve right away with accompaniment of your choice, or scrape into a vessel 
   and chill until set, then cut into pieces for grilling, searing, or frying.

Notes
=====
[1] Any medium- or coarse-ground cornmeal will work here, whether the package 
    says "polenta" or not; avoid instant polenta, which promises a quick 
    cooking time but delivers subpar flavor and texture.

[2] Milk will produce a rich and creamy polenta that's delicious and indulgent, 
    but also heavy.  Stock (vegetable or chicken) will infuse the polenta with 
    more flavor, but that flavor can also cover up the taste of the cornmeal. 
    Water produces the lightest polenta, with a mild corn flavor that pairs 
    well with everything and won't leave you feeling weighed down after eating 
    it.
