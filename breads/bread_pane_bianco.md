Pane Bianco \
Time = 30 min prep + 2 x 60 min rises + 35-40 min bake \
Servings = 1 loaf of bread 

**Dough Ingredients**

- 360g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 8g table salt
- 1 large egg
- 113g milk, lukewarm
- 74g water, lukewarm (or see notes section for *tangzhong technique*)
- 35g olive oil

**Filling Ingredients**

- 85g shredded Italian-blend cheese, or the cheese of your choice
- 113g oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes or your own oven-roasted tomatoes
- 3 to 6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
- 14g chopped fresh basil, green or purple

**Directions**

1. Combine all of the dough ingredients in a bowl (or stand mixer). Mix and knead — by hand, using a mixer, to make a smooth, very soft dough. The dough should stick a bit to the bottom of the bowl if you're using a stand mixer.

2. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise until it's doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes. 

3. Meanwhile, thoroughly drain the tomatoes, patting them dry. Use kitchen shears or a sharp knife to cut them into smaller bits. Shears are also useful for chopping the basil. Mince garlic. 

4. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it into a 22" x 8 1/2" rectangle, deflating it slightly. Top with the cheese, tomatoes, garlic, and basil.

5. Starting with one of the long edges, roll the dough tightly into a log. Pinch the edges to seal. Place the log seam-side down on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.

6. Using a sharp knife or kitchen sheers, cut the dough. Start 1/2" from one end and cut the log lengthwise down the center about 1" deep (but not completely through), to within 1/2" of the other end.

7. Keeping the cut seem face up, shape the log into an "S" shape. Tuck both ends under the center of the "S" to form a "figure 8" and pinch the ends together to seal. While shaping the loaf, tuck any larger pieces of tomato or basil down into the dough (to avoid charring).

8. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 to 60 minutes (or see notes section on overnight rise.)

9. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 350F. 

10. Uncover the bread, and bake it for 35 to 40 minutes, tenting the loaf with foil after 20 to 25 minutes to prevent over-browning.

11. Remove the bread from the oven, and transfer it to a wire rack to cool. Enjoy warm or at room temperature. Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days or freeze for longer storage.

**Notes**

1. Recipe from King Arthur Flour [website](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pane-bianco-recipe)

2. For an overnight rise: Follow the recipe as written through shaping the loaf (step 7). Cover the bread and refrigerate it for 8 to 12 hours, or overnight. When you are ready to bake, let the loaf rest at room temperature for about 15 to 20 minutes while the oven preheats to 350°F, then bake as directed (step 10). 

3. To make a softer loaf, try the *tangzhong technique*, a Japanese method for increasing the softness and shelf life of yeast rolls. Begin by measuring out the flour and milk you’ll be using in the recipe. Now take 3 tablespoons of the measured flour and the 1/2 cup milk; put them in a saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it forms a thick slurry; about 1.5 to 2 minutes. Transfer the cooked mixture to a bowl and cool until lukewarm, then combine with the remaining flour and the other dough ingredients, increasing the amount of water to 99g. Proceed with the recipe as directed.
