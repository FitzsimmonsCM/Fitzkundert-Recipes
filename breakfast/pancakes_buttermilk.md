**Basic Dry Pancake Ingredients**

-  10 ounces (about 2 cups) all-purpose flour
-  1 tsp baking powder
-  1/2 tsp baking soda
-  1 tsp kosher salt
-  1 Tbsp sugar

**For Each Batch of Pancakes**

-  2 large eggs, separated
-  1.5 cups (about 12 ounces) buttermilk
-  1 cup (about 8 ounces) sour cream (see notes)
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for serving
-  Warm maple syrup

**Directions**

1.  For dry pancake mix: Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until homogeneous. Transfer to an airtight container. The mix will stay good for 3 months. (See notes.)

2. For each batch of pancakes: Place one batch of dry mix in a large bowl. In a medium clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. 

3.  In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogeneous. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking. 

4.  Carefully fold in the egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined. Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps).

5.  Heat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. 

6.  Use a 1‚ÅÑ4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. 

7.  Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and butter.


**Notes**

1.  Pancake dry mix can be scaled up as many times as you'd like. Each batch of pancakes takes 11 ounces of dry mix to make (about 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons). 

2.  The sour cream can be replaced with more buttermilk.
