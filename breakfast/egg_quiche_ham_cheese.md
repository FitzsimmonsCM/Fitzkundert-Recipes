**Ingredients**

- 2 sheets of refrigerated pie crust
- 2 cups ham, fully cooked and diced
- 2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded
- 2 tsp dried onion, minced
- 8 large eggs
- 2 cups half-and-half cream
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 400F. Unroll pie crusts into 2 x 9-inch pie plates. Flute edges.

2. Line unpricked pie crusts with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Fill with pie weights, dried beans or uncooked rice. Blind bake crusts until light golden brown, approx 10-12 minutes. Remove foil and weights; bake until bottom is golden brown, 3-5 minutes longer. Cool on wire racks.

3. Divide ham, cheese and onion between crusts. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, cream, salt and pepper until blended. Pour into crusts. 

4. Cover crust edges loosely with foil. Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, approx 35-40 minutes. Quiche is finished when it’s puffy and set at the edges. It should have a slight wobble in the center. 

5. Let stand 5-10 minutes before cutting and serving. 

**Notes**

1. To store, tightly cover the dish, or transfer leftover slices to an airtight container. Quiche may be stored refrigerated for up to 4 days, but is best enjoyed within 1-2 days. 

2. You can substitute milk instead of heavy cream, but the quiche will be thinner and less flavorful. We like using half-and-half because of its rich flavor, and it’s thick enough to create a robust egg custard. Do not use skim or fat-free milk. The custard will not set properly without the right amount of fat. 

3. Prebaking the pie crust for quiche is not required; however, this extra step ensures the pie crust will cook fully without overcooking the filling. Otherwise, the crust might turn out soft or gummy.
