**Ingredients**
- 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon harissa
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 6 large eggs
- 1/4 cup loosely packed chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems
- 2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
- Crusty bread or pita, for serving (optional)

**Directions**

1. Crush the tomatoes. Pour the tomatoes and their juices into a large bowl. Carefully crush with your hands into bite-sized pieces; set aside.

2. Sauté the aromatics. Heat the oil in a 10- or 12-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and sauté until translucent and softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the tomato paste, harissa, garlic, cumin, and salt, and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.

3. Simmer the tomato sauce for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Simmer gently until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.

4. Crack the eggs into the sauce. Remove the skillet from the heat. Make 6 small wells in the sauce. Crack an egg into each well.

5. Spoon some sauce over the egg whites. Gently spoon a bit of sauce over the egg whites, leaving the yolks exposed (this will help the whites cook faster so they set before the yolks). Cover and return the skillet to medium-low heat.

6. Cook the eggs 8 to 12 minutes. Cook, rotating the pan as needed so that the eggs cook evenly, until the whites are set and the yolks are to your desired doneness, 8 to 12 minutes (check on it a few times). The eggs should still jiggle in the centers when you gently shake the pan.

7. Finish with cilantro and cheese. Remove from the heat. Sprinkle with the cilantro and feta, if using, and serve with bread or pita if desired.

**Notes**

- The perfect egg consistency is set whites and runny yolks. As soon as whites are set and eggs jiggle a bit in the center, they are done. 

- To help control egg cooking, remove skillet from heat when adding the eggs and return to simmer at med-low heat. 

- Spoon sauce over the whites--this helps whites cook before yolks

- Rotate the skillet a few times, as different places are hotter than others.

- This hearty recipe also makes a great dinner dish!
