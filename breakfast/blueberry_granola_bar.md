Ingredients:
----

**Bars**
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1.5 cups brown rice krispies
- 1/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut (can omit if desired)
- 1/4 cup whole roasted almonds, roughly chopped
- 1 Tbsp chia seeds
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup peanut butter or almond butter,  (I typically use peanut butter)
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1.5 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup dried blueberries (can sub dried strawberries)

**Greek Yogurt Coating**

- 1 Tbsp water
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp gelatin
- 1/4 cup greek yogurt
- 1 Tbsp honey
- pinch of salt
- 2 cups powdered sugar

**Other materials**

- parchment paper
- wire cooling racks


Directions:
----

1. Line an 9x13 square Pyrex pan with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl combine the oats, rice krispies, coconut, almonds, chia seeds and salt. Mix together.

3. In a small microwave safe bowl combine the almond butter and honey. Microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until the mixture is hot and pourable. Add the vanilla and mix again.

4. Add the honey mixture to the dry oat mixture and mix until everything is moist and combined. Gently stir in the blueberries. Press the mixture into the prepared pan and then using the back of a measuring cup press the mixture into the pan until it is tightly packed. Cover and place in the freezer for 1-2 hours. Cut into 9-12 bars and return to the freezer.

5. Make the greek yogurt coating. Combine the water and vanilla in a small bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin over top and whisk with a fork until the gelatin is evenly distributed. Set aside for about 5 minutes or until needed. It will set into a thick paste.

6. In another small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, honey, and salt. Microwave on 15 second bursts, stirring in between each burst, until the yogurt is liquidy and very warm to the touch. Don't let it start to boil or the yogurt will curdle. I microwaved mine for 30 seconds total.

7. Whisk the gelatin into the warm yogurt mixture. Whisk until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Scrape the yogurt mixture into a medium mixing bowl. Pour the powdered sugar on top. Use a mixer or whisk until the yogurt and powdered sugar combine into a thick, but pourable, coating.

8. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Working with one frozen bar at a time, dip the bottom of the bar into the yogurt and allow any excess to drip off. Flip the bars over so the yogurt coated side faces up and place on the prepared baking sheet. They will be very sticky. Repeat with the remaining bars. Let the bars sit, uncovered, without touching, overnight or up to 2 days until the yogurt is dry to touch. 

9. Once the bars are completely dry, flip them over so the yogurt coated side is now facing down. Drizzle the remaining coating over the bars and allow the bars to sit overnight or up to 2 days until the yogurt is dry to touch.

10. Once the bars are completely dry, store in an airtight container at room temperature.


Notes:
----

If you want an extra thick yogurt coating double the recipe for the Greek Yogurt and repeat the dipping process twice just as directed.
