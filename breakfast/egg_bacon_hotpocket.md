**Ingredients**
----
- 120g Diced, Short Cut Bacon (can substitute beef or turkey bacon)
- 6 Whole Eggs & 150g Egg Whites, whisked (can substitute 8 regular eggs)
- 400g All-Purpose Flour
- 420g Low Fat Greek Yogurt
- low-fat cheddar cheese, grated (approx 1/4 to 1/2 cup)
- 2 Tsp Baking Powder
- 160g Low Fat Grated Cheese (20g per hot pocket)
- Chives (minced)
- Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Salt & Black Pepper (to your taste)

**Directions**
----
1. Cook bacon until crispy. Set aside on paper towel to absorb excess oil. Dice

2. Cook eggs on low or medium-low heat until fluffy. Season with salt and pepper. 

3. To prepare dough, mix 400g AP Flour, baking powder, yogurt, onion, garlic powder, salt. Mix until dough reaches a crumbly texture. With floured hands, knead and roll into a ball, being careful not to overwork. 

4. Cut dough into 8 equal balls and flatten with the palm of your hand. 

5. Sprinkle dough with a thin layer of cheese, then top with bacon, egg, and chives. 

6. Pinch outside edges of dough together to form a pocket and seal it in the middle. Once joined in the middle, flip the dough over, seam side down, and flatten gently again. 

7. Cook in the skillet on medium heat for 5-6 min per side until golden and crispy. 

8. Enjoy immediately or allow to cool and store in foil wrap in the freezer for 2-3 weeks. 


**Reheat instructions**
----
Microwave = 3 - 5 Minutes (flip half way) \
Air Fryer = 5 - 10 min 180C (350F) \
Conventional Oven = 5 - 10 min 200C (400F) 

**NOTES**
- If you find yourself have trouble forming the dough from it being too sticky, start by adding the flour first then slowly add the yogurt & mix it together.
- Depending on the yogurt brand some contain less or moisture than others causing it to be stickier. If this happens slowly add more flour until you reach a consistency you can work with & make sure to add some flour to your hands as well.
