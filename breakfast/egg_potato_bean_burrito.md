**Ingredients**
----
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- black pepper (to your taste)
- 2 large yukon gold potatoes, diced small (about 1/2-inch cubes)
- 1 small red or yellow onion, chopped
- 1 large red bell pepper, diced
- 2 jalapeños, small dice
- 1 can (15 oz) low sodium black beans, drained an rinsed
- 12 large eggs
- 8 burrito-sized flour tortillas
- salsa (homemade or store-bought, to your taste)
- 1.5 cups sharp cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese, grated
- Optional: 1/2 lb bacon, cooked and diced (Can substitute 1/2 lb breakfast sausage, remove from casing and cooked)
- Optional: 5 oz baby spinach (1 package from salad section)
- Optional: Pickled jalapeños (to your taste)
- To Garnish: hot sauce, avocado or guacamole, sour cream


**Directions**
----

1. Preheat oven to 400F. 

2. Line a large baking sheet with foil. Separately, toss potatoes, pepper(s), and onion in olive oil and toss with chili powder and cumin. Place them each down in their own section of the pan. (This allows you to rescue some items sooner if they cook faster.) Bacon can be added to the pan at this step as well. 

3. Cook for 20-30 min. Bacon should be cooked through and crisp. Remove and set aside on a paper-towel lined tray. Use a large, thin spatula to turn potatoes and onions and peppers. Return them to the oven until the potatoes are tender. When potatoes are tender, scatter spinach on top and return to oven for 3-5 min or until it wilts. 

4. Remove from oven and toss to mix. Scatter rinsed black beans and chopped bacon over the roasted ingredients. 

5. Whisk your eggs together in a large bowl until lightly beaten. Season well with salt and pepper. Heat your largest frying pan. Once hot, add eggs, stirring every 30 sec to allow cooking. 

6. To assemble burritos: Place a large square of foil on your counter. Place first tortilla over it. Eyeball about 1/8 of the vegetable mixture and scoop it into the center, followed by a little salsa (1 to 2 Tbsp per burrito), 1/8 the eggs, cheese to taste, plus any other fixings you cannot live without.

7. Roll the burrito tightly by folding the sides over the filling then rolling from the bottom up. Wrap in foil the same way; folding the foil first over the ends of the burrito (ideally forming a “cup” at each end to catch drips). Burrito can be eaten immediately or frozen for up to 1 month. 


**Notes**
----

1. The base recipe is vegetarian (eggs, beans, potatoes) but bacon or crumbled breakfast sausage can be added. 

2. These can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.

3. If eating right away: rewarm the foil-wrapped burritos on a tray for 5 minutes in a 350-degree oven. (This is just to get everything hot again and melt the cheese.)

4. To freeze: Place foil-wrapped burritos in a freezer bag and press all of the air out. They will keep in the freezer for 1 month. 

5. To warm from the freezer in the oven: Place foil-wrapped burritos on a tray in a 350-degree oven for 30 to 40 minutes (turn over halfway) to heat them through. To check, press a toothpick through the foil into the center of a burrito and pull it out; if the toothpick feels warm or hot, the burrito is heated. If it’s cold, it needs more time.

6. To warm from the freezer in a microwave: Remove foil and microwave for 2-3 minutes, turning burrito over halfway. I find microwaves range a bit in defrosting times so you might find you need more or less.

7. To defrost in the fridge and warm in the oven: If you’re a plan-ahead type, you can let it begin defrosting in the fridge overnight. Heat in the oven the same way as the frozen ones, but check after 20-30 min. Don't leave burritos in flour tortillas in the fridge for more than overnight; the wetness of the fillings can make the wrappers soggy.
