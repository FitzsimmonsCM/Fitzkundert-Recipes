From: Louise Goupil

**[Ingredients]**

-   2 cups all purpose flour
-   1 Tbsp baking powder
-   3 Tbsp (45g) granulated sugar
-   1/4 tsp salt
-   1/4 cup butter
-   2 large eggs
-   1/3 cup whipping cream
-   Handful of dried fruit, chopped if needed.

**[Directions]**

1.  Preheat convection oven to 350F

2.  Mix flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter with your fingers.

3.  In a separate bowl, beat eggs and cream. Reserve 1-2 Tbsp. Add remaining mixture to dry ingredients until the dough is even and sticks together.

4.  Fold in dried fruit and knead dough into a ball, being careful not to overwork.

5.  Pat dough into 1 inch thick rounds or triangles, depending upon your preference. Brush the tops with the reserved egg mixture and sprinkle a bit of extra sugar if desired.

6.  Bake for 25 min or until golden. Enjoy immediately!

**[Notes]**

-   On step 4, don't stress too much about correct fruit folding instructions. I've ignored this and it's turned out fine.
-   Apricots were suggested by Louise in the original recipe
-   Blueberries work great in this recipe
-   If you use raisins, add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to make cinnamon-raisin scones.
