**Ingredients-Muffins**

-   3 cups AP flour
-   2.5 tsp baking powder
-   1/4 tsp baking soda
-   1 tsp salt
-   1/8 tsp nutmeg, freshly grated
-   1.5 sticks (12 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened
-   1/2 cup granulated sugar
-   2 large eggs
-   1 cup whole-fat eggnog
-   12 cup muffin tin
-   muffin liners

**Ingredients-Topping**

-   4 Tbsp unsalted butter
-   1 cup powdered sugar

**Directions**

1.  Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle position. Line 12-cup muffin tin with liners.

2.  Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg.

3.  In a bowl of a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat butter on med-high until creamy, scraping down sides as needed. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, scraping down sides as needed. Beat eggs 1 at a time, beating until batter is smooth.

4.  Remove mixing bowl from mixer and use stiff spatula for next step.

5.  Add 1/4 of the flour mixture ot the bowl and mix until barely combined. Then add 1/3 of the eggnog until batter smoothes out again. Continue alternating flour and eggnog, ending with the last 1/4 flour mixture. At this point, the batter should be thick, somewhere between liquid batter and stiff bread dough. Avoid overmixing, but ensure all ingredients are fully incorporated.

6.  Divide batter between muffin tins, filling each one almost to the top. Bake until muffins have puffed over the top and are starting to brown around the edges, and a cake tester comes out clean, approx 25-30 min. Transfer to a wire cooling rack.

7.  When muffins are cool enough to handle, but still warm, melt butter in a microwave safe dish (or the stove) and brush the tops with a pastry brush. Place powdered sugar in a bowl and dop the tops of each muffin in the sugar. Once you complete the first round, dip each muffin in the sugar a second time.

8.  Muffins are best fresh from the oven, but keep for 1-2 days. Enjoy!
