From: Kevin and Jill

**Ingredients--Rolls**

-   16-18 frozen white bread rolls (Rhodes's rolls or similar)
-   1/2 cup unsalted butter
-   1/2 cup brown sugar
-   1 package of butterscotch pudding mix (regular, not instant. See notes below)
-   pecans
-   cinnamon
-   bundt pan

**Ingredients-Butterscotch Pudding**

-   1/4 cup brown sugar
-   1 Tbsp sugar
-   2 Tbsp dried milk powder
-   3 Tbsp cornstarch
-   pinch of salt

**Roll Directions--the night before**

1.  Grease a bundt pan and scatter pecans evenly in the bottom

2.  Add rolls to bundt pan in a few layers

3.  Melt butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small saucepan. Bring to boil. Add pudding mix (see below) and bring back to boil, then remove from heat.

4.  Pour pudding mix over the rolls.

5.  Cover with saran wrap and let rise overnight at room temp.

**Roll Directions--the next morning**

6.  Preheat oven at 350F. Once oven is preheated, bake for 25 min.

7.  Allow to cool for 3-4 min before carefully inverting onto a serving platter. Scrape out any toppings hiding in the pan onto the top of the rolls.

**Pudding Directions**

1.  Mix together all ingredients

2.  Add mixture to melted butter / sugar in step 3 of the directions.

3.  If you actually want to make pudding (why would you when you could have tasty pecan rolls?) mix in 2 cups of milk and bring to simmer for approx 5 min or until thickened. Remove from heat, add 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 Tbsp butter, and refrigerate until sufficiently chilled.
