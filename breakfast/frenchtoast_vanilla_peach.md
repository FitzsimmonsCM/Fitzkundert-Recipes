CMF Notes = Everyone loves this. Perfect for the summer with fresh peaches.

**Ingredients**

-   1 cup (packed) brown sugar (dark or light is fine, I prefer light)
-   1/2 cup butter
-   2 Tbsp water
-   29oz peaches sliced and drained (2-3 ripe if you are using fresh fruit. Fresh fruit is much better, in my opinion!)
-   5 eggs
-   1 Tbsp vanilla extract
-   1/4 cup milk
-   3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
-   Thick, crusty bread (French or Italian style loaves are good for this) cut into 3/4" slices.
-   9" x 13" baking pan (or similar)
-   Aluminum Foil
-   Optional--powdered sugar (garnish)
-   Optional--splash of heavy whipping cream

**Directions--the night before**

1.  In a saucepan, melt together butter, sugar and water. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.

2.  If using fresh peaches, wash and slice thinly. If using canned peaches, drain and slice.

3.  Slice bread into 3/4" think slices

4.  In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, splash of cream (optional), vanilla and cinnamon.

5.  Pour the butter/sugar mixture into the bottom of the baking pan. Tilt the dish to ensure the entire bottom is coated with the glaze.

6.  Place the peaches in a single layer over the sugar coating.

7.  Dunk slices of bread into the egg mixture, making sure to coat both sides. Arrange bread over peaches (generally, I try to angle the slices of bread so they overlap a bit and melt together when baking.)

8.  Pour any remaining egg mixture over the slices of bread. Garnish with a pinch of cinnamon over the bread.

9.  Cover with foil and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.

**Directions--the following morning**

1.  Preheat Oven to 350ÂºF

2.  Remove pan from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temp (approx. 20 to 30 minutes)

3.  Place pan in oven. Bake for 25 minutes covered.

4.  After 25 minutes, remove foil. Continue baking for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.

5.  Remove from oven and allow to cool briefly before serving. Optional, sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving.
