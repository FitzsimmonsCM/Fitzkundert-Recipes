Ingredients
===========
1 cup syrup:
- 113 g pomegranate juice (1/2 cup, 150 g seeds)
- 100 g sugar (just less than 1/2 cup)

Directions
==========
- Combine juice and sugar.

- Keep at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves 
  completely.  Expect this to take several hours.

- Store in the refrigerator or freezer, preferably in an air-tight container.  
  Expect a shelf-life of 3-6 months.

Notes
=====
- [1] calls for some fancier ingredients too, but "pomegranate simple syrup" 
  seems to be a common way to make grenadine.

- A commenter in [1] points out that it's best to avoid heating juice if 
  possible, since doing so can affect the flavor.  [2] also mentions that 
  heating can cause sucrose to split into glucose and fructose, which affects 
  flavor (and texture).  These concerns make sense to me, so I modified the 
  recipe to avoid heating.

- The first time I made this, I measured that 1/2 cup fresh-squeezed 
  pomegranate juice weighs 112 g.  That's 224 g/cup, which is almost identical 
  to the density of water, which is 227 g/cup.  Going forward, I'll just assume 
  that pomegranate juice and water have the same density.

- According to the USDA, 100 g of 100% pomegranate juice has 12.6 g of sugar 
  [3].  This is accounted for in the "1 cup" recipe above.  The goal is to have 
  a total of 200 g of sugar (see below for more details).  The juice itself 
  accounts for 14 g of sugar, so only 186 g needs to be added.

- "Rich" vs "simple" syrup:

  - This recipe was originally a "rich" syrup, or a 2:1 v/v ratio of sugar to 
    water.  Because water is slightly more dense than sugar, this corresponds 
    to a 1.762:1 m/m ratio (e.g. 186 g sugar to 113 g juice).  Note that this 
    is relatively close to the solubility limit of sugar in water, which is 
    2000 g/L, or a 2:1 m/m ratio.

  - Rich syrups have significantly longer shelf life than "simple" syrups (1:1 
    v/v ratio), because they have less free water.  This inhibits microbial 
    growth.  However, [2] mentions that cold-processing can reduce shelf life, 
    because the boiling step kills any microbes present in the syrup to begin 
    with.

  - 2024/11/02: I decided to switch the recipe to simple syrup:

    - With the rich recipe, I never got all the sugar to dissolve, even after 
      several days.
    - Cocktail recipes all assume that grenadine is a simple syrup, and it's a 
      pain to try to adjust for that.
