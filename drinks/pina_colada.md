Ingredients
1 ½ cups frozen pineapple
1 ½ cups ice
5 ounces (½ cup plus 2 tablespoons) aged rum
2 ounces (4 tablespoons) cream of coconut (not coconut cream; see notes*)
4 ounces (½ cup) pineapple juice
1 ounce (2 tablespoons) lime juice
For the garnish: cocktail cherry

Ingredients
===========
4-6 servings:
- 6 oz white rum
- 6 oz cream of coconut (see notes: not coconut cream!)
- 6 oz pineapple juice
- 1/2 cup frozen pineapple chunks (see How to Cut a Pineapple)
- 4 cups ice

1 serving:
- 1.5 oz (40 g) white rum
- 1.5 oz (≈40 g) cream of coconut
- 1.5 oz (42 g) pineapple juice
- 1 cup ice (technically ≈236g, but I'd probably just do 120 or so, because 
  it's not supposed to be a solid chunk of ice).

Notes
=====
- Use "cream of coconut", not "coconut cream" [2].  The former is just the 
  latter with lots of sugar added, so if you have the latter, you can also just 
  add sugar to taste.

- This recipe calls for frozen pineapple chunks.  They help make the drink 
  thicker and frothier, but other recipes leave this ingredient out.
