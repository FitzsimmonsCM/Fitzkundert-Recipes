Ingredients
===========
- 6 g freeze-dried blackberries (≈6-8 berries)
- 6 g dried orange slices (≈2 slices)
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 320 g vodka

Directions
==========
- Mix all ingredients in a mason jar.

- Infuse until the blackberry and orange flavors reach the desired strength, 
  5-7 days.

  - Mix periodically by inverting.

- Strain out the fruit using a coffee filter.

- Store in the refrigerator.

Notes
=====
- 2026/01/03: We found a few other recipes that used 1/4 cup sugar, but it 
  looked like a lot once we added it to the jar.

  - This is not actually a recipe; it's just a picture of a product that we 
    think we bought a few years previously.  From it, we counted about 6 
    blackberries and 2 orange slices.
