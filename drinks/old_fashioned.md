Ingredients
===========
- 2 oz. (1/4 cup, 1 finger) high-proof bourbon (cheap is ok!)
- 1 tsp. simple syrup
- 1-5 dashes (1/8-1/2 tsp) Angostura bitters (to taste)
- Lemon peel
- Orange peel
- 1-2 ice cubes

Notes
=====
- Avoid as much pith as possible when slicing peels.  In fact, using a 
  vegetable peeler works well for this.

- See this website for more info on making citrus twists:

- Twists the peels to help release the essential oils, then drop the peel in 
  the drink.
