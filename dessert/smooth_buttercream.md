Ingredients
===========
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) (115g) salted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup (95g) shortening
- 4 cups (480g) powdered sugar
- 2-3 tbsp (30-45ml) water, milk, or cream
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions
==========
1. Combine butter and shortening and mix until smooth.
2. Add 2 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth.
3. Add vanilla extract and 1-2 tbsp of water or cream and mix until smooth.
4. Add remaining powdered sugar and mix until smooth.
5. Add a little more water or milk until desired consistency is reached.

Notes
=====
- Make sure butter is at room temperature, or it's really hard to get it 
  smooth.

- You can add different extracts to change up the flavor. You can also add 
  1/4-1/2 cup of cocoa and a little more liquid to get a chocolate icing. 
  For a peanut butter icing, add 3/4 cup of peanut butter.
