Ingredients
===========
- 226 g (8 oz) bittersweet chocolate
- 85 g unsweetened baking chocolate
  - only get about 40-50 g of chocolate dust from a 113 g bar, so buy 2-3 bars.

- 305 g all-purpose flour
- 50 g (1/4 cup) sugar
- 383 g brown sugar
- 480 g (4 cups) powdered sugar
- 95 g (1/2 cup) shortening
- 2 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt

- 7 large eggs
- 227 g (1 cup) sour cream (full fat)
- 1 pint (2 cups) heavy whipping cream
- 1 stick unsalted butter
- 1 stick salted butter

Notes
=====
- The above ingredient quantities are enough for a two-tier cake (6", 8").  To 
  make a 6" cake (i.e. personal-size), halve the recipes.  To make the full 
  3-tier cake (6", 8", 10"), double the recipes.
