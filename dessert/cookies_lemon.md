**Fresh Ingredients Lemon Crinkle Cookies**

- 240g all-purpose flour, sifted
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 200g granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 3 tsp freshly grated lemon zest (approx 1 medium lemon)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp lemon extract
- approx 1 cup confectioner's sugar (for coating)

- Medium mixing bowl
- Large mixing bowl
- Small sauce pot
- parchment paper
- Cookie sheet
- Wooden spoon or whisk 
- Stand mixer (optional)

***Directions***

1. Mix together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. 

2. In a small sauce pot, melt 1/2 cup of butter. Set aside and allow to cool to 90-100ºF

3. In a large bowl, whisk together butter and granulated sugar until combined. Add in egg and egg yolk, mixing to combine. 

4. Whisk in vanilla and lemon extracts, followed by lemon juice and lemon zest.

5. Slowly stir in dry ingredients (A stand mixer is helpful if you are making a double batch, but not required). If necessary, use your hands to bring the dough together. 

6. Rest in the fridge for 2-4 hours. 

7. At the end of the rest time, preheat the oven to 325ºF

8. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 

9. Roll dough into balls (approx 20-25 g in weight) and roll in confectioner's sugar to coat. 

10. Place sugar-coated dough on a baking sheet approx 2 squares of parchment paper apart.  

11. Bake for 10-13 min, or until the edges are set and the dough in the center is soft, but not jiggling. Keep the remaining cookie dough in the fridge until you are ready to roll the next batch. 

12. Allow cookies to finish "setting" on the cookie sheet for approx 3-4 min before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. 

13. Makes approx 25 cookies and the recipe doubles well! Store cookies in an air-tight container. 




**I'm in a Hurry Lemon Crinkle Cookies**

- 1 box of lemon cake mix (I like Duncan Hines Brand, but any brand is fine)
- 1 egg
- 1 8 oz tub of Cool Whip, thawed
- 1 cup confectioner's sugar (for coating)

- large mixing bowl
- baking sheet
- parchment paper
- Wooden spoon or whisk 

***Directions***

1. Thaw Cool Whip (4 hours in the fridge, or overnight)

2. Preheat oven to 350ºF

3. Mix together cake mix and egg. Then fold in Cool Whip. The mixture will be very fluffy. Just keep stirring until everything is combined! 

4. Drop cookie dough by table spoon into confectioner's sugar and roll to coat. 

5. Set sugar-coated dough on a parchment lined baking sheet, approx 1-2 squares apart. 

6. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until edges are lightly brown and set, and the center is fluffy but not jiggly. 

7. Allow the cookies to finish "setting" for 3-4 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Keep the remaining cookie dough in the fridge until ready to roll the next batch. 

8. Makes approx 35-40 cookies. Store cookies in an airtight container. Best if eaten within 2-3 days. 

9. You may substitute any flavor of cake mix (strawberry or orange cake mix make fun summer cookie flavors, and vanilla cake mix is also very good with the cool whip!)
