Brownie Rollout Cookies \
Yield = Approx 48 cookies \ 
From = Smitten Kitchen

**Ingredients**

- 3 cups (375 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp (3 grams) salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup (225 grams / 2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/2 (300 grams) cups white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla extract
- 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa (approximately 60 grams) (Any brand is fine!) 
- Optional--powdered sugar for glaze


**Directions**

1. Preheat oven at 350 ºF.

2. Whisk flour, cocoa, salt, and baking powder in bowl and set aside.

3. Beat butter and sugar together until fluffy. Mix in eggs (1 at a time) and vanilla until smooth.

4. Gradually add flour mixture, and mix until smooth. Wrap bowl in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour.

5. Generously flour the table / counter. Roll out cookie dough on floured surface to approx. 1/4 inch (5-6 mm) thick.

6. Cut into circles approx 7-8 cm in diameter (or your desired shapes), brushing extra deposits of flour off the top. (Flour disappears during baking, so don’t worry too much if they look a bit pale when placing on the baking sheet.)

8. Bake on a parchment-lined baking sheet for 8 to 11 minutes until the edges are firm and the centers are slightly soft and puffy.

9, Transfer to a rack to cool.

10. Optional Glaze--you can brush the cookies with a sugar glaze (Whisk together 4 parts powdered sugar + 1 part water + a dash of vanilla for flavor) within 5 minutes of coming out of the oven. These also taste really great with vanilla ice cream!
