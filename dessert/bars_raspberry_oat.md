Raspberry Bars
=====
Time = 10 min prep + 25 min cook \
Servings = 1 pan of bars \
From: John Allen

**Ingredients**
- 9 in x 13 in pan
- 2 cups rolled oats (can substitute quick oats for more crumbly texture)
- 2 cups AP flour
- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 1.25 cups packed brown sugar (light preferred, but either will work)
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 12 oz seedless raspberry jam (jam comes in 15 oz jars and I generally just use the whole thing)

**Directions**

1. Preheat convection oven to 350F

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine butter and sugar. Once mixed, add salt, baking powder, oats, and flour. Mix until crumb-like consistency is reached. 

3. Reserve 2.5 cups of crumbs. Pack remaining crumbs into the bottom of the pan. 

4. Bake for 10-15 min. Remove from oven and then spread jam evenly over the crust. Sprinkle remaining crumbs on top and press down lightly. 

5. Bake approx. 15 more minutes, watching frequently to prevent burning. Allow to cool before cutting. Enjoy!
