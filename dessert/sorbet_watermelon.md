Watermelon Sorbet
====

Time = 5 hr prep + 10 min cook \
Servings = approx 4 cups \
Keeps 4-5 days frozen

**Ingredients**
----

- 750 g seedless watermelon, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 3 Tbsp lime juice (approx 1-2 limes)
- optional, pinch of sea salt

**Directions**
----

1. Cut watermelon into 1-inch cubes. Place on parchment lined baking sheet and freeze for approx 5 hr or until frozen into ice-cube like pieces. 

2. Add watermelon chunks, lime juice, and a pinch of sea salt into a blender or food processor. Working in batches if needed, blend watermelon until it reaches the consistency of shaved ice. Serve immediately or store in the freezer for 4-5 days. 

**Notes**
----
1. This recipe scales down well and can be made with as little as half a miniature watermelon and half a lime. 

2. If you do not have a high power blender, it's ok to let the watermelon cubes sit at room temp for 5-10 min to soften. Do not allow them to melt completely. 

3. We found the food processor was superior to the blender in giving us a consistent ice texture throughout.
