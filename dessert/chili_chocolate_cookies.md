[Ingredients]
- 1 stick unsalted butter
- 4 oz high-quality unsweetened chocolate, rough chop
- 1 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup AP flour, sifted
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 Tbsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

[Directions]

1. Preheat oven to 325F

2. In a heatproof bowl, melt chocolate and butter together, whisking until glossy. (This can be done in the microwave in 20-30sec burst or in a glass bowl set over simmering water.) Cool to room temp. 

3. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla extract, and eggs on low speed with the paddle attachment until combined. Pour in cooled chocolate and continue to mix until evenly distributed. 

4. In medium bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, chili powder, baking soda, salt, and cayenne pepper. Add dry ingredients slowly to stand mixer and mix on low speed until just combined. Fold in chips with spatula. 

5. Working in batches, scoop 12 balls of dough (approx 1.5 Tbsp size) onto parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie. Bake for approx 14-15 min, rotating pan halfway through cooking. Cookies should be puffy and soft when removed from oven. 

6. Slide cookies, still on parchment paper, onto wire cooling rack. Cool 5-10 min before serving. Cookies can be stored in an air-tight container for 2-3 days.
