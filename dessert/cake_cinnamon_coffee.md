- 298g granulated sugar
- 71g brown sugar, packed (either light or dark)

- 1.25 cup (283g) whole milk, room temp (2% skim ok to substitute)

**Directions**
----
1.  Preheat oven to 350ÂºF. Lightly great 9 x 13 or 9 x 9 cake pans. 

2. To make the topping: Whisk together sugar, salt, flour and cinnamon. Add melted butter, stirring until well combined. Set aside. 

3. To make filling: Mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and cocoa powder. Set aside. 

4. To make cake: In a large bowl, beat together butter, salt, sugars, baking powder, and vanilla until well combined and smooth. 
5. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. 

6. In a separate bowl, whisk together sour cream / yogurt and milk until well combined. Some lumps are ok. 

7. Add flour to butter mixture. Alternately add milk mixture. beating gently to combine after each addition. 

8. Spread half the batter into the pans, spreading all the way to the edges. 

9. Sprinkle filling evenly on the batter. 

10. Spread remaining batter atop the filling. Use a table knife to gently swirl the filling into the batter, as though making a marble cake. Don't combine filling and batter thoroughly. 

11. Sprinkle the topping over the batter in the pan. 

12. Bake 55-60 min until cake is dark golden brown around the edges and the top is medium-golden with no light patches showing on top. A toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center should come out clean. When pressed gently in the middle, the cake should spring back. 

13. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool for 15-20 min before serving. Serve directly from the pan. 

14. Store leftover cake well wrapped at room temperature for 2-3 days. Freeze for longer storage. 


**Notes**
----

1. To make a glaze, combine 57g confectioner's sugar and 1 Tbsp milk. Drizzle over the cooled coffee cake. 

2. Since butter and sour cream are both key ingredients in this cake, we encourage you to use the best quality you can get. We highly recommend Cabot, a superb Vermont brand available nationally.

3. It's easy to spread half the batter in the pan when you know how much it weighs. If you have a kitchen scale, half the batter weighs about 28 ounces (approx 3 cups for large pan, 1.3 cups for each small cake round)

4. To prepare this coffee cake the night before, simply cover the unbaked cake with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. Next morning, bake the cake as directed. Start testing for doneness at the end of the suggested baking time; you'll probably have to add 5 minutes or so to the total time, to account for the batter being chilled.
