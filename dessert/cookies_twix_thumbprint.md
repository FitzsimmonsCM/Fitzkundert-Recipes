====

Time = 15 min prep + 10 min bake + 1 hr rest \
Servings = approx 24 cookies \
From: Cookies for Days

**Ingredients**
----

- 1 cup (222g) salted butter, softened
- 1 1/4 cup (137g) powdered sugar
- 1 egg
- 3 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 1/2 cups (295g) cake flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 30 soft caramels
- 1 tbsp milk
- 1/2 cup milk chocolate melting wafers (can also use melted chocolate chips)

**Directions**
----

1. Preheat the oven to 350° F (180°C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set aside.

2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the butter, powdered sugar and egg until well combined. Add the vanilla extract and mix well. Lastly, add the cake flour, baking powder and salt. Mix until a very soft dough forms.

3. Allow the dough to rest for 5 minutes to make it easier to handle.

4. Portion the dough out into 1 tbsp portions. Roll into a ball and arrange on the cookie sheet. Using a 1/2 tsp measuring spoon, press down in the center of the ball of dough to make a crater. (Note: I find that this is easier if I dip the measuring spoon into flour in between pressing on each ball of dough.)

5. Once all of the cookies have been pressed, bake at 350° F (180°C) for 8-10 min. The cookies will spread but should have a faint crater in the middle still.

6. Immediately after pulling the cookies out of the oven, take a 1 Tbsp measuring spoon and press down in the center of the cookie, deepening the ‘thumbprint’. (Note: Mking the thumbprint after cookies come out of the oven does not work--the cookies fall apart.)

7. Allow the cookies to cool completely. Once the cookies are completely cool, melt together the caramels and milk in the microwave. Microwave for 30 seconds and then stir until melted and smooth.

8. Carefully spoon caramel into the center of each cookie. Allow the caramel to set-the cookies can be placed in the fridge to help speed up this process.

9. Once the caramel has set up, drizzle melted milk chocolate onto the tops of the cookies. Allow chocolate to set.

10. Once chocolate has set, enjoy! Cookies can store at room temperature or in the fridge for up to 4 days.
