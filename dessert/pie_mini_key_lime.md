From: MacKenzie Harrigan

**Ingredients**
----

*Crust*

- 180g graham cracker crumbs (about 12 full sheet graham crackers)
- 6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted
- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar

*Filling*

- 4 ounces (113g) full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature
- 4 large egg yolks
- one 14 oz can (396g) full-fat sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 cup (120ml) key lime juice*
- optional: lime slices and whipped cream for garnish


**Directions**
----
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 12-count muffin pan with liners and a second 12-count muffin pan with only 4 (since this recipe makes only around 16). Set pans aside.

2. Make the crust: Grind full-sized graham crackers in food processor or blender. Combine crumbs in a medium bowl with melted butter and granulated sugar. Mixture should be course and sandy. Press a heaping Tbsp into each liner making sure it is tight and compact. Pre-bake 5 min and allow to cool. 

3. Make the filling: In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. On medium-high speed, beat in the egg yolks, scraping down the sides as needed. On high speed, beat in the sweetened condensed milk and lime juice until just combined.

4. Pour the filling evenly into each crust. Bake for 15–16 minutes or until the centers of the pies only slightly jiggle. Allow the pies to cool at room temperature in the pan set on a wire rack. Once completely cool, place the pan in the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.

5. Once chilled, serve the key lime pies cold with whipped cream and a lime slice if desired. Store leftover pies in the refrigerator (covered) for up to 1 week.

**Notes**
----

1. To make ahead, you can prepare the crust ingredients and the filling ingredients separately. Store each covered tightly in the refrigerator until ready to assemble and bake. 

2. To freeze, key lime pies freeze well, up to 2–3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before serving.

3. Key Lime Juice: For the best flavor, make sure you use key lime juice. You can juice your own key limes or buy it from the store. It is usually with the regular lime and lemon juice in the juice aisle. In a pinch, you can use regular lime juice.

4. To make a full-sized pie, use this crust and filling recipe. Press crust into a 9-inch pie dish. Pre-bake for 12 minutes at 350°F (177°C). Pour in filling. Bake for 18 minutes, and then allow to cool at room temperature before chilling in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
