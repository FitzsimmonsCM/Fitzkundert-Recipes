**Bread Pudding Ingredients**

-  9 oz fresh sourdough bread (approx 7-8 slices)
-  2 large eggs
-  1/2 cups milk
-  1 tsp vanilla
-  1/3 cup white sugar
-  1/4 tsp cinnamon (optional)
-  1/4 cup pecans, chopped (optional)
-  1/2 cup granny smith apple, medium dice

**Cream Sauce Ingredients**
-  3 Tbsp unsalted butter
-  1/4 cup white sugar
-  1/4 cup heavy cream
-  2 Tbsp whiskey or bourbon (more if you want it boozier)


**Directions**

1.  Chop bread into 1 inch cubes and let sit overnight to become stale

2.  Butter a glass baking dish with 3-4 cup capacity (8 x8 square or similar). Arrange bread cubes in an even layer in the dish. 

3.  In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon. Pour mixture over bread and press cubes into custard sauce. 

4.  Sprinkle apple and pecans on top and allow mixture to soak while the oven preheats to 325F. 

5.  Place baking dish on a small sheet pan and bake 30-40 min. Baking time will vary based on the size and staleness of the bread. The pudding is done when the edges are lightly brown, the middle appears puffy, and pricking with a fork reveals no runniness. 

6.  Allow to cool away from the oven while you make the sauce. 

7.  In a small saucepan, melt butter, sugar, and heavy cream together over low heat, whisking frequently. Once sugar has completely dissolved, remove from heat and whisk in the whiskey. 

8. Serve sauce and bread pudding while still warm. 


**Notes**
1. This recipe doubles easily and is very flexible and forgiving. 

2. Even if you double the bread pudding recipe, the sauce recipe can stay the same. We always have plenty of extra sauce! 

3. Experiment with different topping and whiskey combinations. We've tried fresh peaches, and that works really well. Another favorite combo is cherries + cherry bourbon.
