**Ingredients**
----

- 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
- 2 (3.4-ounce) boxes instant lemon pudding mix
- 3 cups cold whole milk
- 2 Tbsp granulated sugar
- 2 tsp finely grated lemon zest (from 1 medium lemon), plus more for garnish
- 1 (11-ounce) box vanilla wafer cookies, divided
- 1/4 plus 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
- 8 Tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar, divided
- 2 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 1 medium lemon)
- 1 tsp lemon or vanilla extract


**Directions**
----

1. Line an 8x8-inch baking pan (about 2 inches high) with 2 sheets of parchment paper, positioning them perpendicular to each other, so that the parchment hangs about 2 inches over all 4 sides of the pan to form a sling.

2. Whisk 2 (3.4-ounce) packages instant lemon pudding mix and 3 cups cold whole milk together in a large bowl until dissolved and slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Let sit to thicken while you prepare the crust and other layers.

3. Rub 2 Tbsp granulated sugar and 2 tsp finely grated lemon zest together in a small bowl until fragrant. Transfer to a food processor.

4. Reserve 5 cookies from 1 (11-ounce) box vanilla wafers for topping. Place the remaining cookies and 1/8 tsp of the kosher salt in the food processor. Process until the cookies are the texture of sand, about 15 seconds. Add 1 stick melted unsalted butter and pulse until combined, 6 to 8 (1-second) pulses.

5. Transfer the mixture to the baking pan. Use the bottom of a flat measuring cup or your fingers to press the crumbs into an even layer, making sure to reach the edges and fill the corners. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling.

6. Beat 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream and 1/4 cup of the powdered sugar together in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment on high speed until stiff peaks form, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to another bowl.

7. Beat 8 ounces room-temperature cream cheese, the remaining 1/4 cup powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 teaspoon lemon extract, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt together in the stand mixer (no need to clean) with the whisk attachment on medium speed until light and very fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a flexible spatula halfway through, about 3 minutes total.

8. Transfer 1 cup of the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture and gently fold together with a flexible spatula until just combined. Dollop the cream cheese mixture over the crust and spread into an even layer.

9. Dollop the lemon pudding over the cream cheese mixture and spread in an even layer. Dollop the remaining whipped cream over the lemon layer and spread into an even layer. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.

10. When ready to serve, crush the reserved 5 cookies and sprinkle over the top. Garnish with more finely grated lemon zest if desired. Grasping the excess parchment, transfer the slab to a cutting board. Cut into 12 pieces, wiping the knife between each cut for cleaner cuts.
