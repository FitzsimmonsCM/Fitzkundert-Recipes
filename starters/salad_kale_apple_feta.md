**Ingredients**

-   1 shallot
-   1 apple
-   4 oz kale
-   2 tsp dijon mustard
-   0.5 cups feta, crumbled
-   1 can chickpeas
-   1 tsp garlic powder
-   5 tsp balsamic vinegar
-   2 oz mixed greens
-   1 oz dried cranberries
-   1/4 tsp granulated sugar
-   salt/pepper to your taste
-   olive oil

**Directions**

1. Wash and dry produce.
   
2. Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallot. Drain and rinse chickpeas; dry thoroughly with paper towels. Halve, core, and dice apple into 1/2-inch pieces.

3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add shallot and chickpeas; season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chickpeas are warmed through and browned in spots, 2-4 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.

4. Meanwhile, remove and discard any large stems from kale; chop into bite-size pieces.

5. Place kale in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage with a large drizzle of olive oil until leaves are tender, 1-2 minutes (similar to how you would knead dough).\
TIP: Don't skip this step-massaging helps the kale leaves wilt slightly.

7. In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar, Dijon, 3 TBSP olive oil, and 1/4 tsp sugar 

8. Add mixed greens, shallot and chickpeas, apple, and feta to bowl with kale. Drizzle with dressing to your taste; toss to combine.

9. Divide salad between bowls and garnish with dried cranberries.
