Whiskey Sour \
Time = 10 min \
Servings = 1 drink \
From: John Allan 

**Ingredients**
-  2 ounces bourbon
-  3/4 ounce lemon juice, freshly squeezed
-  1/2 ounce simple syrup
-  1/2 ounce egg white (optional)
-  Angostura bitters, to garnish

**Directions**

1.  Add bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup and egg white, if using, to a shaker, and dry-shake for 30 seconds without ice.

2.  Add ice and shake again for 15–20 seconds, until well-chilled.

3.  Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice, or into a coupe without ice.

4.  Garnish with 3–4 drops of Angostura bitters


**Notes**

1.  Consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs poses a risk of food-borne illness.

2.  The traditional Whiskey Sour recipe includes egg white for texture. However, it is not at all necessary. Omitting the egg white makes a drink that packs all the tart flavor of the original, but will taste a bit cleaner and more refreshing, rather than richer and dessert-like.

3.  The easiest go-to whiskey is bourbon. This whiskey has a natural sweetness that complements lemon perfectly, and is easier to balance than ryes or scotch.
