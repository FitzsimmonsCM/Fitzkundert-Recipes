**Ingredients**
----

- 2 lbs ground turkey or beef
- 2 packets taco seasoning
- water (as indicated by seasoning packet)
- 2 large heads romaine lettuce, rinsed and chopped into bite-sized pieces
- 3-4 medium tomatoes, chopped
- 1 medium cucumber, peeled and chopped
- 1 cup chopped red or white onion
- 1.5 cups shredded Monterey Jack
- 1.5 cups shredded Extra sharp cheddar cheese
- 1 family-sized bag Doritos (Nachio cheese or cool ranch flavor) crushed into bite-sized pieces
- 1 small can (2.25 oz) sliced black olives, drained
- Kraft zesty italian dressing
- optional: 1 (15 oz) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- optional: additional toppings as desired (avocado, corn, diced bell pepper, cilantro, etc)


**Directions**
----

1. In large pan, cook turkey or beef over medium heat until fully cooked (approx 8 min). Drain excess fat. Add taco seasoning and water according to packet instructions . Simmer 3-5 min until thickened. Remove from heat and allow meat to cool to room temp. 

2. In a large salad bowl, combine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, and onion. Add olives, black beans, and other hearty ingredients if using. Sprinkle cheese evenly over salad. 

3. Once meat is cooled, add to salad bowl and toss gently to distribute. 

4. Immediately before serving, gently fold in crushed doritos and toppings such as avocado or cilantro. 

5. Serve with italian dressing on the side so guests can season to their taste. 

**Notes**
----

1. Cooling the meat prevents wilting lettuce and maintains optimal salad texture. 

2. Keep dressing separate to preserve salad crispness. 

3. Toppings can be modified to your taste! Play around and see what you like.
