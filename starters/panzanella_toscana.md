Author's Note: Panzanella is one of the starring recipes on the table in Summer. Use stale bread and garden vegetables for a simple dish. Panzanella is a cold dish, no cooking required. The stale Tuscan bread is soaked in water and white wine vinegar, which gives panzanella an intense and characteristic flavor. Tomatoes and red onions are a must, to which cucumbers can be added depending on the area and what is available. 


**Ingredients**

- 350 g stale Tuscan bread 
- 220 g ripe cluster tomatoes
- 200 g cucumber, peeled and diced into quarter moons 
- 90 g red onions, peeled and thin sliced 
- Basil â€“ A LOT! Tear by hand. 
- 250 g water (variable depending on how much the bread needs to be moistened)
- 60 g white wine vinegar 
- extra virgin olive oil, to your taste 
- fine salt and black pepper, to your taste 


**Directions**
----

1. Cut the bread into coarse cubes 

2. Transfer the bread to a bowl and add water and vinegar. Mix well so that the bread can evenly absorb the soak and set aside. OPTIONAL, but recommended: instead of using water and vinegar, split the tomatoes in half and rub the bread slices evenly, so it will absorb the tomato juice, becoming tender. If the bread is very stale, consider combining the two approaches. 

3. Proceed with preparing the vegetables: cut the tomatoes first into quarters and then into smaller pieces. 

4. Remove the peel from the cucumber, trim the ends and cut it in half lengthwise, then slice it thinly. Finally, peel the onion, cut it in half and slice it thinly. 

5. Go back to the bowl with the bread and mix again, then add the onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Mix together and then add basil, tear basil by hand. 

6. Season with salt, pepper, and oil. Mix again and keep your panzanella in the refrigerator until it's time to serve it.
