From: Cheryl Fitzsimmons

----**Ingredients**----

- 2 can (8 oz) refrigerated pillsbury original crescent rolls
- 8 slices provolone cheese, halved
- 1/4 lb deli sliced ham
- 1/2 cup roasted red bell peppers (from a jar), drained and patted dry
- 1/3 lb deli sliced hot salami
- 1/4 lb deli sliced capocollo or prosciutto
- 1/4 cup hot pepper rings (from a jar), drained and patted dry
- 1/8 tsp black pepper


----**Directions**----

1. Preheat oven to 375F (350F if using non-stick cooking sheet)

2. Unroll both cans of dough and separate into 16 triangles. On a large, ungreased cookie sheet, arrange the dough triangles so the short edge of the tringle form a 5-inch circle in the center. The triangles should overlap and the dough ring should look like the sun. 

3. Place 8 cheese halves on top of each triangle, close to the center ring. Cheese will overlap. Layer the remaining ingredients in the following order:

- TOP
  - 8 cheese halves
  - pepper rings
  - capocollo slices
  - salami slices
  - roasted red peppers
  - ham
  - 8 cheese halves
- BOTTOM

4. Bring the long end of each dough triangle up and over the filling. Tuck the dough under the bottom layer of dough to secure it. It is ok if some filling peaks out. Sprinkle lightly with black pepper. 

5. Bake for 23-28 min or until dough is golden brown and throughly cooked. Cool 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.
