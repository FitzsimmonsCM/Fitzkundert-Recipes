[Ingredients]
- 1 cubanella pepper, deseeded and diced
- 2 scallions, thin slice, separate whites and greens
- 12 oz yukon gold potatoes, quartered
- 14 oz (1 can) yellow corn, drained
- 1 Tbsp flour
- 3/4 cup milk
- 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
- 2 Tbsp sour cream
- veggie stock concentrate
- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 Tbsp cream cheese
- old bay seasoning (to taste)
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- rolls (garnish)

[Directions]

1. Melt 2 Tbsp butter in pot over medium heat. Add green pepper and scallion whites. Cook 2-3 min and season with salt and pepper. 

2. Add flour to pot. Cook, stirring, until lightly brown. Approx 1 min. 

3. Slowly stir milk into pot a splash at a time until fully incorporated. Add 1.5 cups water, diced potatoes, stock concentrate, and old bay.

4. Bring to a boil and reduce to simmer until potatoes are tender and can be stabbed with a fork (approx 20 min). 

5. Once potatoes are tender, reduce heat to low and mash with potato masher. Mash until mostly smooth, leaving a few potato lumps for texture. 

6. Add cream cheese, corn, and jack cheese until fully incorporated. Chowder should be very thick at this point. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

7. Divide chowder between bowls and garnish with sour cream, green onions, and serve with dinner roll.
