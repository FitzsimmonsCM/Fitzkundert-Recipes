**Ingredients**

-  Chocolate Chipotle Powder (@ Tbsp high quality cocoa powder, 1 Tbsp ground chipotle, 1 Tbsp ground pepitas)
-  1/5 oz dark chocolate liqueur
-  1.5 oz chocolate vodka
-  1.5 oz tequila (100 percent agave reposado)
-  1.5 oz coffee liqueur (Kahlua or similar)

**Directions**

1.  Rim 2 8 ounce martini glasses in chocolate chipotle powder. Roll the edge of each glass on a clean wet sponge, then roll the edge over the powder. Tap the glass gently to remove extra powder. 

2.  Pour remaining ingredients into a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously unil the outside of the shaker is frosty. Strain immediately into glasses and serve. 


**Notes**
1.  When making chipotle powder, fold together carefully to avoid knocking powder into the air and iritating nose and eyes.
