From = HelloFresh

**Ingredients**

- 1 shallot, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 zucchini, trimmed and quartered lengthwise
- 1 green onion, thin sliced, separate whites and greens
- 4 oz grape tomatoes, halved
- 1.5 oz sundried tomatoes, diced
- 1 Tbsp Italian or Tuscan spice
- 3/4 cup Arborio rice
- 2 tsp vegetable stock concentrate
- 5 tsp balsamic vinegar
- salt and pepper, to your taste
- 3 Tbsp Parmesan cheese, fresh grated 
- olive oil
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter

- sheet pan
- skillet
- kettle or medium pot of simmering water

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle position.

2. Bring pot of water (at least 6 cups) to a boil and then reduce to simmer and 
   keep on the side. If using a faster electric kettle, water can be boiled 
   during step 4. 

3. Toss zucchini and grape tomatoes with a drizzle of oil and Tuscan spice. 
   Roast on middle rack until lightly browned, approx 25 min.

   - Thoroughly dry the zucchinis and tomatoes before roasting.
   - Place the tomatoes skin-side down, so that they come off the baking sheet 
     more easily and don't pop out of their skins as easily.

4. In a large skillet, saute shallot over medium heat until lightly browned, 
   approx 3-4 min. Add rice, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes, and cook, stirring 
   often until garlic is fragrant, approx 1-2 min. Season with salt and pepper. 

5. Slowly add 1 cup hot boiling water and stock concentrate to pan with rice. 
   Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has mostly absorbed. Repeat with 
   remaining water, adding it 1/2 cup at a time and stirring until liquid has 
   absorbed and rice is al dente, approx 25-30 min. 

6. Once rice is cooked, reduce heat to low. Stir in balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp 
   Tuscan spice, parmesan, 1 Tbsp butter, and salt and pepper until melted. 
   Stir in zucchini and grape tomatoes (if roasted separately).
  
7. Divide risotto between plates. Garnish with onion greens and Parmesan and 
   serve. 

**Notes**

- Recipe doubles well if you need to serve more people. 
- If you would like to add Italian sausage, saute sausage (casing removed) and 
  set aside. Then cook shallots and rice in the same pan. Stir in meat before 
  serving.
