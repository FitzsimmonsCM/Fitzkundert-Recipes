Servings = 2 hearty servings \
From = HelloFresh

**Ingredients**

- 1 shallot, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 zucchini, trimmed and quartered lengthwise
- 1 green onion, thin sliced, separate whites and greens
- 4 oz grape tomatoes, halved
- 1.5 oz sundried tomatoes, diced
- 1 Tbsp Italian or Tuscan spice
- 3/4 cup Arborio rice
- vegetable stock concentrate (approx 1 tsp per 1 cup water) (can also use liquid vegetable stock if you have it, approx 4 cups)
- 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
- salt and pepper, to your taste
- 3 Tbsp Parmesan cheese, fresh grated 
- olive oil
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter

- sheet pan
- skillet
- kettle or medium pot of simmering water

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 450F with rack in middle position. 

2. Bring pot of water (at least 6 cups) to a boil and then reduce to simmer and keep on the side. If using a faster electric kettle, water can be boiled during step 4. 

3. Toss zucchini and grape tomatoes with a drizzle of oil and Tuscan spice. Roast on middle rack, tossing halfway, until lightly browned, approx 14-16 min. \
**NOTE**, to reduce number of pans, the zucchini and tomato can be cooked in a skillet with the shallot. 

4. In a large skillet, saute shallot over medium heat until lightly browned, approx 3-4 min. Add rice, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes, and cook, stirring often until garlic is fragrant, approx 1-2 min. Season with salt and pepper. 

5. Slowly add 1 cup hot boiling water and stock concentrate to pan with rice. Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has mostly absorbed. Repeat with remaining water, adding it 1/2 cup at a time and stirring until liquid has absorbed and rice is al dente, approx 25-30 min. 

6. Once rice is cooked, reduce heat to low. Stir in balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp Tuscan spice, parmesan, 1 Tbsp butter, and salt and pepper until melted. Stir in zucchini and grape tomatoes (if roasted separately).
  
7. Divide risotto between plates. Garnish with onion greens and Parmesan and serve. 

**Notes**

- Recipe doubles well if you need to serve more people. 
- If you would like to add Italian sausage, saute sausage (casing removed) and set aside. Then cook shallots and rice in the same pan. Stir in meat before serving.
