Servings = 2 hearty servings \
From = HelloFresh

**Ingredients**

- 1 shallot, diced
- 1 green onion, thin sliced, separate whites and greens
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 zucchini, trimmed and quartered lengthwise
- 113 g grape tomatoes, halved
- 20 g sundried tomatoes, diced
- 1 Tbsp Italian or Tuscan spice
- 135 g (3/4 cup) Arborio rice
- 2 tsp chicken stock concentrate
- 5 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 Tbsp Parmesan cheese, grated 

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in upper position.

2. Bring pot of water (at least 6 cups) to a boil and then reduce to simmer and 
   keep on the side.

3. Toss zucchini and grape tomatoes with a drizzle of oil and Tuscan spice. 
   Roast until lightly browned, approx 25 min.

   - Thoroughly dry the zucchinis and tomatoes before roasting.
   - Place the tomatoes skin-side down, so that they come off the baking sheet 
     more easily and don't pop out of their skins as easily.

4. In a large skillet, saute shallot and green onion whites over medium heat 
   until lightly browned, approx 3-4 min. Add rice, garlic, and sun-dried 
   tomatoes, and cook, stirring often until garlic is fragrant, approx 1-2 min. 
   Season with salt and pepper.

5. Slowly add 1 cup hot boiling water and stock concentrate to pan with rice. 
   Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has mostly absorbed. Repeat with 
   remaining water, adding it 1/2 cup at a time and stirring until liquid has 
   absorbed and rice is al dente, approx 25-30 min.

6. Once rice is cooked, reduce heat to low. Stir in balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp 
   Tuscan spice, Parmesan, and butter.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

7. Divide risotto between plates. Top with roasted veggies, and garnish with 
   onion greens and Parmesan.

**Notes**

- If you would like to add Italian sausage, saute sausage (casing removed) and 
  set aside. Then cook shallots and rice in the same pan. Stir in meat before 
  serving.
