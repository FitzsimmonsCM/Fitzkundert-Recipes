Soy Miso Soup \
Time = 10 min prep + 50 min bake \
Servings = 16 bites 

**Ingredients**

- 1.5 cups dashi (seaweed stock) or vegetable broth
- 1 pinch white sugar
- 1 dash soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp miso (paste)
- 2 Tbsp diced tofu
- 4 shiitake mushrooms (or other fresh mushrooms), cleaned and sliced
- 1 Tbsp slivered scallions
- optional: 1 dash sake


**Directions**

1. In glass measuring cup, combine dashi, sugar, soy sauce, sake and mushrooms.

2. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 2 min. Allow broth to steep for 5 min. (Can also heat in a small saucepan, but be careful not to boil). 

3, Stir the miso into the broth and add the tofu. If the liquid isn't hot enough, return the cup to the microwave for an additional 30 seconds but don't allow the liquid to boil (this destroys the fragrance and flora of the miso)

4. Add scallions and serve. 


**Seasonal Suggestions**

1. Chopped greens, such as spinach, tatsoi, or arugula (add with miso)

2. Slivers of fennel, bok choy, broccoli, zucchini, or sugar snap peas (added before the first heating)

3. A few strips of salmon or chicken (if uncooked, add at start of recipe and allow meat to be poached. If cooked, add with miso paste)

4. Rice noodles, cooked rice, bean sprouts (add with tofu)

5. Small bits of dried seaweed (add at start of recipe)


**Notes**

1. Part of what makes traditional miso soup sublime is the selection and balance of individual ingredients. More is not merrier. Remember that restraint is the order of the day.
