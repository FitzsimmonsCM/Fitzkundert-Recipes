**Ingredients**
----
-  1.5 Tbsp (22.5 mL) extra-virgin olive oil
-  2 cups (280 grams) diced onion (1 medium/large)
-  2 large garlic cloves, minced
-  2 tsp ground turmeric
-  1.5 tsp ground cumin
-  1/2 tsp cinnamon
-  1/4 tsp ground cardamom
-  1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can diced tomatoes, with juices
-  1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can full-fat coconut milk (see notes)
-  3/4 cup (140 grams) uncooked red lentils, rinsed and drained
-  3 1/2 cups (875 mL) low-sodium vegetable broth
-  1/2 tsp fine sea salt + more to your taste
-  Freshly ground black pepper, to your taste
-  Red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper, to your taste 
-  1 (5-ounce/140-gram) package baby spinach
-  2 teaspoons (10 mL) fresh lime juice, or more to taste

**Directions**
----
1.  In a large pot, add the oil, onion, and garlic. Add a pinch of salt, stir, and sauté over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes until the onion softens.

2.  Stir in the turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, and cardamom until combined. Continue cooking for about 1 minute, until fragrant.

3.  Add the diced tomatoes (with juices), entire can of coconut milk, red lentils, broth, salt, and plenty of pepper. Add red pepper flakes or cayenne, if desired, to taste. Stir to combine. Increase heat to high and bring to a low boil.

4.  Once it boils, reduce the heat to medium-high, and simmer, uncovered, for about 18 to 22 minutes, until the lentils are fluffy and tender.

5.  Turn off the heat and stir in the spinach until wilted. Add the lime juice to taste. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if desired. Ladle into bowls and serve with toasted bread and lime wedges.

**Notes**

1.  Full-fat coconut milk is preferable. If all you have on hand is light canned coconut milk that’ll work in a pinch—it just won't be as rich and creamy.
