**Ingredients**
----
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 large cloves garlic, thin sliced
- 3 Tbsp tomato paste (ok to add 1 Tbsp more)
- 2 15 oz cans white beans (Cannellini or Great Northern)
- 1/2 cup boiling water
- 1/3 lb mozzarella cheese, coarsely grated (approx 1.3 cups)
- salt and pepper, to your taste

**Directions**
----

1. Preheat oven to 475ºF

2. In 10-inch ovenproof skillet (cast iron or similar), heat olive oil on medium high heat. Fry garlic approx 60 sec or until fragrant. 

3. Stir in tomato paste being careful to avoid splattering and fry for 30 sec. Reduce heat as needed to prevent garlic from burning. 

4. Add beans, water, and generous pinch of salt and black pepper. Stir to combine. 

5. Sprinkle cheese evenly over the top and bake until cheese is melted and browned in patches, approx 5-10 min. If necessary, toast under broiler for 1-2 min to brown. 

6. Serve with toasted bread (italian, bagguette, sour-dough or similar)
