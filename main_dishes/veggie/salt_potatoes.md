**Ingredients**
----

- 4 lbs new or young potatoes (red or yukon recommended, but any kind are ok)
- 1.5 cups fine salt
- 8 Tbsp butter, melted
- 2 Tbsp fresh herbs (rosemary, parsley, thyme) (optional)

**Directions**
----

1. Wash but do NOT peel potatoes, set aside. 

2. Fill a large stock pot with water. Stir in salt until fully dissolved and no salt sinks to the bottom of the pot. 

3. Place potatoes in the bottom and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender but firm, approx 15 min. 

4. Drain potatoes, cover to keep hot and allow the salt crust to form. 

5. While potatoes are resting, melt butter over medium heat. Drizzle onto potatoes and toss with fresh herbs. 


**Notes**
----
- Goes well with [Cornell BBQ chicken]() and baked beans! 

- History: The Syracuse area of New York has a long history of salt production. Brine from salt springs located around Onondaga Lake was used to create consumable salt that was distributed throughout the northeast via the Erie Canal. In the 19th century, Irish salt miners would bring a bag of small, unpeeled, potatoes to work each day, and boil the potatoes in the salt blocks.
