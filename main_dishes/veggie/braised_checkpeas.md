- Fresh-ground black pepper
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
- 6 oz or 2 large portobello mushrooms, 1/2 inch slices
- 4 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1.5 Tbsp dark brown sugar
- 3 or 4 cups vegetable stock
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 15oz cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 bay leaf

- Dutch oven
- If you don't have dutch oven, use a saute pan and then transfer to 9 x 13 baking dish

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 350F

2. Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat and add onion; cook 3 minutes, until softened. 

3. Add garlic and cook 2 minutes more. Add the carrots, 1 teaspoon salt, freshly ground black pepper, and red pepper flakes and cook for 2 more minutes, until they begin to glisten. 

4. Add the mushrooms and cook for 4 minutes, until they begin to soften. 

5. Add tomato paste and brown sugar and cook until well-incorporated, approx 3 minutes. 

6. Add 3 cups stock, vinegar, Worcestershire or soy sauce, chickpeas, and bay leaf and bring to a simmer with another teaspoon of kosher salt and more ground pepper.

7. Once simmering, either cover tightly with a lid or pour into your baking dish and cover with a lid or tightly with foil and transfer to oven. 

8. Braise chickpeas and vegetables for 90 minutes, checking at the 1 hour mark to make sure the chickpeas havenâ€™t absorbed all of the broth (and adding the remaining 1 cup broth if so). 

9. Remove from oven, discard bay leaf, and adjust seasonings to taste. Serve.
