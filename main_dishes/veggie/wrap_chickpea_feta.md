**Ingredients**
----
- 1 (15-ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
- 2 Tbsp finely chopped fresh dill
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp fine salt
- Freshly groud black pepper
- 4 (9- to 10-inch) regular or whole-wheat tortillas
- 1 cup loosely packed baby spinach leaves
- 1/2 medium English cucumber, cut into 1/4-inch-wide sticks
- 1 cup roasted red peppers, thinly sliced

**Directions**
----

1. Place the beans in a medium bowl and smash with the back of a fork or potato masher until most of them are broken up. 

2. Add the yogurt, feta, dill, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and mix to combine.

3. Divide the mixture across the center of the tortillas. Spread into a 2-inch-wide band across the center of each tortilla. 

4. Top the mixture with the spinach, cucumber sticks, and peppers. Tightly wrap each one like a burrito (see How To Wrap a Burrito). Serve


**Notes**
----
1. These can be made up to 1 day ahead and stored refrigerated in plastic wrap to avoid drying out. 

2. They are a favorite recipes of friends with new babys (because they can be eaten cold and with 1 hand!)

3. Recipe doubles well
