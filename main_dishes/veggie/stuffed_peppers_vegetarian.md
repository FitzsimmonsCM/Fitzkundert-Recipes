-  4 roma tomatoes, fine diced
-  1.5 cups Israeli couscous
-  2 Tbsp Italian seasoning blend

-  1 small bunch Italian parsley, minced
-  1 small bunch chives, thin sliced

**Directions**

1. Adjust oven rack to top position and preheat to 425 ÂºF. 

2. Halve bell peppers and remove seeds and stems

3. Rub peppers with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange on a baking sheet cut sides down. Roast until soft and starting to brown (18-22 min)

4. Heat drizzle of olive oil in medium pot over medium heat. Add couscous, shallot, garlic, italian seasoning, and half the tomatoes. Cook, stirring, for 1-2 min or until garlic is fragrant. 

5. Add 1.5 cups water, vegetable stock concentrate, and pinch of salt. Bring to boil then reduce heat to low. Cover and cook approx 8 min or until couscous is tender. 

6. In a medium bowl, combine 1/2 tomatoes, chives, 1/2 parsley, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

7. Once peppers are done, remove from the oven. Turn off the oven and turn ON the broiler. 

8. Flip the peppers over on the baking sheet so they form a boat. Stuff the pepper boats with as much couscous as will fit inside. Sprinkle the top with mozzarella. 

9. Broil until the cheese bubbles, melts and is slightly brown (2-4 min). 

10. Divide remaining couscous between plates. Top with stuffed peppers, and top peppers with remaining tomato mixture. Garnish with any remaining herbs.
