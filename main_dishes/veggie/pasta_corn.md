**Ingredients**
----

- extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 cup panko
- 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- koshar salt and freshly ground black pepper (to your taste)
- 3.5 cups fresh sweet corn kernals (from approx 6 ears of corn)
- 2 cloves garlic, smashed
- 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese
- 1 lb spaghetti or another pasta
- 2 pts cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 cup fresh basil, rough chop


**Directions**
----

1. In a large saute pan, heat 1 Tbsp oil over medium heat. Add panko, crushed red pepper flakes, and 1/4 tsp salt. Cook 3-5 min or until panko is golden brown. Remove to small bowl.

2. Wipe saute pan. Add 3 Tbsp olive oil and add garlic, corn, and salt. Cook 8-10 min or until corn is tender. 

3. Allow corn to cool for 10 min. Remove 1/2 cup of kernels and set aside. Transfer remaining kernels to food processor. Add 1.5 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Process until coarsely pureed. With food processor running, add 3 Tbsp olive oil and process until smooth. Add parmesan and pulse until just combined. 

4. Meanwhile, bring large pot of salted water to rolling boil. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions. 

5. While pasta cooks, transfer corn puree back to saute pan. Add 1/4 cup pasta water and bring to simmer over low heat, stirring until smooth. Can add an additional 1/4 cup pasta water if pesto seems very thick. 

6. When pasta is done, transfer with tongs to saute pan (do not drain!) and toss to coat. Add cherry tomatoes and reserved kernels and toss again. 

7. Serve in bowls and garnish with panko and basil leaves. _
