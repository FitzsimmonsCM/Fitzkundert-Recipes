Ingredients
===========
4 servings:
- 1 lb tomatillos
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 jalapeno peppers
- 2 poblano peppers
- 2 serrano peppers
- 2 tbsp cilantro (chopped)
- 1/2 tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups broth
  - 2 tsp stock concentrate
- 1 lime

The precise selection of peppers isn't critical.  For a hotter sauce, maybe 
substitute a poblano for a jalapeno, serrano, or habanero.  For a milder sauce, 
maybe substitute a serrano for a poblano.

Directions
==========
- Preheat oven to 425°F

- Prepare the vegetables:

  - Peel and rinse the tomatillos, then cut them in half.
  - Cut the peppers in half lengthwise and remove their seeds.  The membrane is 
    the spiciest part, so either keep it or remove it depending on your taste.
  - Break the garlic cloves out of the bulb, but leave them unpeeled.

- Coat the vegetables in oil and place them (skin side up for the peppers and 
  tomatillos) on a baking sheet.

- Roast for 20-30 min, until the pepper skins are charred.

  - Broiling is also an option.  This is faster, but requires more attention.

- Purée the tomatillos, peppers, garlic, and spices:

  - You may optionally remove the skins from the peppers.
  - Squeeze the roasted garlic out of its skin.
  - A food processor works well for this step.

- Add the broth and lime juice, then continue puréeing until smooth.

- Transfer to a sauce pot and simmer for 5-10 min, to thicken.
