**Ingredients**
----
- 1 cubanella pepper, deseeded and diced (can substitute 1-2 jalapenos or 1 medium poblano for a bit more spice)
- 2 scallions, thin slice, separate whites and greens
- 12 oz yukon gold potatoes, quartered
- 14 oz (1 can) yellow corn, drained (can also use frozen corn, just give it enough time to thaw)
- 1 Tbsp flour
- 3/4 cup milk (whole milk gives a creamier base but 2% milk is also ok!)
- 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese, grated
- 2 tsp veggie stock concentrate
- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 Tbsp cream cheese
- 1 tsp old bay seasoning (+ more to your taste)
- salt and pepper (to your taste)
- 2 Tbsp sour cream (to garnish)
- rolls or thick sliced bread (to garnish)

**Directions**
----
1. Melt 2 Tbsp butter in pot over medium heat. Add green pepper and scallion whites. Cook 2-3 min and season with salt and pepper. 

2. Add flour to pot. Cook, stirring, until lightly brown. Approx 1 min. 

3. Slowly stir milk into pot a splash at a time until fully incorporated. Add 1.5 cups water, diced potatoes, stock concentrate, and old bay.

4. Bring to a boil and reduce to simmer until potatoes are tender and can be stabbed with a fork (approx 15-20 min). 

5. Once potatoes are tender, reduce heat to low and mash with potato masher. Mash until mostly smooth, leaving a few potato lumps for texture. 

6. Add cream cheese, corn, and jack cheese until fully incorporated. Chowder should be very thick at this point. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

7. Divide chowder between bowls and garnish with sour cream, green onions, and serve with bread or dinner roll.
