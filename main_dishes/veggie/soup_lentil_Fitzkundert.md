Lentil Stew \
Time = 15 min prep + 45 min cook \
Servings = 4 servings 

**Basic Ingredients**

-  1 Tbsp olive oil
-  1 medium yellow or white onion, finely chopped
-  1 celery stalk, chopped (can sub 1 red or green pepper)
-  2 carrots, peeled and chopped
-  1 fist-sized yellow potato, chopped
-  1 tsp dried thyme
-  1 tsp dried oregano
-  1/2 tsp paprika
-  1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
-  1 cup lentils, picked over and carefully rinsed (green or red)
-  1 14 oz can diced tomatoes, including liquid
-  4 cups water or 2 cans vegetable stock
-  salt and pepper (to your taste)
-  optional: croutons or thick sliced bread for garnish
-  optional: parmesan cheese for garnish


**Directions**

1. In a large pot heat olive oil until it shimmers. Add onion and cook until it is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add celery and carrots and cook until they begin to soften, another 5 minutes.

2. Add herbs and lentils and stir until lentils are coated. Cook for about 30-60 sec or until aromatic. Add tomatoes and potatoes, breaking them up if they are whole. Add water or stock and stir. 

3. Heat to boiling, then reduce heat and simmer and cook until lentils have softened and are cooked through, about 35 to 40 minutes.

4. Blend with an immersion blender, so that the soup is smoother, but still contains chunks of vegetables. (Note--If you don't have this type of blender, I just smash the veggies a bit with a potato masher. This helps thicken the stew.)

5. Ladle into bowls and add garnish, if using. Serve immediately. Makes enough for 4 people.


**Notes**
1.  This recipe is very forgiving on the exact amounts of things. You don't have celery? Add more carrot or potato, etc. 

2.  Green lentils hold up to cooking better than red lentils, but both can work in this recipe.
