**Ingredients**
-  180g small elbow macaroni
-  180 mL evaporated milk
-  170 g grated mild or medium cheese (cheddar, fontina, gruyere, colby jack)
-  salt and pepper (to your taste)

**Directions**

1.  Place macaroni in a medium saucepan and add just enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. 

2.  Continue to cook until water has been almost completely absorbed, and macaroni is just al dente, approx. 6-7 min. 

3.  Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add cheese, stirring continuously until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, approx 2 min. 

4. Season with salt and pepper and serve. 

**Notes**

1.  Be certain you purchase evaporated milk and *NOT* sweetened condensed milk.

2.  This recipe can be doubled to feed 4 people.

3.  Reducing the cheese to 120g is acceptable if you prefer a less liquidy cheese sauce. 

4.  If you want some additional flavor, try a dash of hot sauce or salsa, hatch green chilis, BBQ sauce, mustard powder, or a knob of butter. Add after the evaporated milk.
