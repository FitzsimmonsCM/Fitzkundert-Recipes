Ingredients
===========
- 1 lb tomatillos
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 jalapeno peppers
- 2 poblano peppers
- 2 serrano peppers
- 2 tbsp cilantro (chopped)
- 1/2 tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 2 cups broth
  - 2 tsp stock concentrate
- 1 lime

The precise selection of peppers isn't critical.  For a hotter sauce, maybe 
substitute a poblano for a jalapeno or a habanero.  For a milder sauce, maybe 
substitute a serrano for a poblano.

Directions
==========
- Preheat oven to 350Â°F

- Peel and rinse tomatillos.  Cut in half, and place them skin-side-up on an 
  oiled baking sheet.

- Slice all of the peppers in half lengthwise, and place them skin-side-up on 
  the same baking sheet.

- Peel the garlic cloves, and place them on the baking sheet.

- Roast for 20-30 min, until the pepper skins are charred.

  - Broiling is also an option.  This is faster, but requires more attention.

- Combine the following, using a food processor:

  - The roasted tomatillos, peppers, and garlic.  Optionally, remove the skins 
    from the peppers.

  - Cilantro, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper

- Add broth and lime juice.  Blend untill smooth.

- Transfer to a sauce pot and simmer for 5-10 min.
