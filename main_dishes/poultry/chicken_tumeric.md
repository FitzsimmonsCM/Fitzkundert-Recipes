**Ingredients**
----
-  1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
-  1/2 cup dry white wine
-  1/2 cup orange juice
-  1 lime, juiced
-  2 Tbsp yellow mustard
-  3 Tbsp brown sugar, more for later
-  2 tsp all-natural garlic powder
-  1.5 tsp ground turmeric
-  1 tsp ground coriander
-  1 tsp sweet paprika
-  Kosher salt and black pepper (to your taste)
-  1 large fennel bulb, cored, sliced
-  1 large sweet onion, sliced into half moons
-  6 pieces bone-in skin-on chicken, (legs, breasts, or a combination)
-  2 Oranges, unpeeled, sliced
-  1 lime, thinly sliced (optional, garnish)

**Directions**
----
1.  Make the marinade. In a large bowl or deep dish, mix together olive oil, white wine, orange juice, lime juice, mustard and brown sugar.

2.  In a small bowl, mix together turmeric, garlic powder, coriander, paprika , salt and pepper. Now, add about half of the spice mix to the liquid marinade. Stir to combine.

3.  Pat the chicken pieces dry and generously season with the remainder of the spice mix. Be sure to lift the chicken skins slightly and apply some of the spice mix underneath the skin.

4.  Add the seasoned chicken and the remaining ingredients to the large bowl of marinade. Work the chicken well into the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours (minimum 30 min).  

5.  When ready, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Transfer the chicken along with the marinade and everything else to a large baking pan so that everything is comfortably arranged in one layer. Be sure the chicken skin is facing up. Sprinkle with a dash of salt and more brown sugar, if desired.

6.  Roast for 40-45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the chicken skin has nicely browned. Internal chicken temperature should be 170F

**Notes**
----
1.  If you don’t have a meat thermometer, cut the chicken open near a bone and examine the juices. If they are bloody or pink, the chicken still needs time. When the juices run clear, the chicken is cooked.

2. Serve with rice or another grain. Lebanese rice or plain basmati rice work well here. You could also definitely serve turmeric chicken with a salad. 

3.  Keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. Use a glass container so the turmeric doesn’t stain. 

4.  If substituting boneless chicken, cover the chicken in foil for the first 10 minutes or so of roasting. This allows steam to cook the chicken from the inside out. Set the oven to 425° F, instead of 475, and the chicken should be cooked in about 18 minutes. 

5.  The best chicken pieces to use are bone-in, skin-on pieces such as chicken legs.
