This meal can be made ahead and frozen as a dump meal for either slow cooker or instant pot. 

**Ingredients**
----

Freeze these ingredients together:

- 1 small onion, diced
- 3 stalks of celery, diced
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger
- 2 medium sweet potatoes, skinned and cut into 1-inch cubes (about 1 pound)
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 5 cups chicken broth or bone broth (use 4 cups if using the Instant Pot method)
- 1/2 tsp dried chopped thyme
- 1/2 tsp coarse sea salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 tsp turmeric
- 1 cup full-fat coconut milk

To make the soup, get these fresh ingredients: 

- 1 head lacinato kale, de-stemmed and roughly chopped
- 2 Tbsp lemon juice (approx 1 medium lemon)

**Directions**
----
1. To freeze this meal, place the onion, celery, garlic, ginger, sweet potatoes, and chicken breasts in the bottom of your container. Then, whisk together the broth, thyme, salt, pepper, bay leaf, turmeric, and coconut milk and pour over the chicken and vegetables. Seal, label, and freeze.


**Crockpot Method**

1. Defrost soup in a bowl of water in the refrigerator overnight.

2. Add frozen ingredients to the slow cooker and cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4 hours.

3. In the last 10 minutes of cooking, add 1 bunch of de-stemmed and chopped lacinato kale. Cook for 10 minutes, then stir in lemon juice and serve.


**Instant Pot Method**

1. Set the frozen ingredients out for about 30 minutes before making, and run under hot water to ensure you can get them out of their container.

2. Place the ingredients in the Instant Pot, then secure the lid and set to cook on high pressure for 15 minutes.Let the pressure release naturally, then remove the lid, 

3. Set the pot to ‘saute’ mode, and stir in the kale. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the kale is bright green and wilted, then stir in the lemon juice and serve!


**Notes**
----

- We prepared this as a postpartum dump meal

- When we made this, we defrosted it in the fridge for 2 days, and then used the instant pot method. The primary flavor was lemon, and the veggies and chicken had essentially disintegrated. If we try it again, I might be interested in the slow cooker method, as well as using larger chunks of veggies and whole chicken breast. 

- The primary flavor was lemon, not curry, and it was quite bland. I found it taste better when a spoonful of sambel oelek is stirred into the bowl as garnish prior to serving.
