Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken Sandwiches \
Time = 30 min prep + 7 hr cook \
Servings = 8-10 sandwiches

**Ingredients**
- 2-3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup barbecue sauce + more to garnish (I like Sweet Baby Ray's)
- 1/3 cup Italian dressing (reduced-fat or fat-free okay)
- 2 Tbsp packed brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 Tbsp cornstarch
- 2 Tbsp chicken broth (water is ok)
- rolls, if serving as sandwiches (potato rolls or kaiser rolls work well)
- bread and butter pickles, optional
- slaw (store bought or homemade)


**Directions**
1. Place chicken in the slow cooker.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the barbecue sauce, Italian dressing, sugar and Worcestershire sauce. Pour the sauce over the chicken. 

3. Cover and cook on low for 7 hours.

4. Remove the chicken to a cutting board. In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and chicken broth. Stir it into the sauce in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on high until the sauce is thickened and heated through (10 to 15 minutes). 

5. Meanwhile, use two forks to shred the chicken. Return the shredded chicken to the slow cooker and stir to coat. Add additional barbecue sauce if more sauce is needed. 

6. Cover and continue cooking on low for 45 minutes. If making sandwiches, serve chicken piled onto rolls. Garnish with extra BBQ sauce, slaw, and pickles, if desired.
