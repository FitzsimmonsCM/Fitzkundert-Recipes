**Basic Ingredients**
----
-  1 medium yellow onion
-  6-8 cloves chopped garlic
-  vegetable oil
-  1.5 tsp ground turmeric
-  1.5 tsp ground coriander
-  1.5 tsp ground cumin
-  optional (1/4 to 1 tsp chili pepper depending on how spicy you like it)
-  2-3 tsp chopped ginger 
-  1.5 tsp tomato paste
-  1.5 lbs protein (chicken breast, chicken thighs, lamb, or beef) chopped into pieces. 
-  1 medium or large potato, diced
-  2 Tbsp whole milk plain yogurt

**Side dishes**
-  Basmati Rice
-  yogurt (raita)
-  Naan (Trader Joe's brand is fine!)
-  salt and black pepper (to your taste)


**Directions**
----
1.  Saute onion in 3-4 Tbsp vegetable oil over medium heat. When onion is softened and slightly browned, add garlic and cook briefly (60 sec) until you just start to smell it. 

2. Add spices in the following order, mixing after each one: turmeric, coriander, cumin, chili pepper (optional), ginger. Spices can be adjusted up or down depending upon your taste, but keep the same overall ratio. 

3. Once spices are mixed, add tomato paste. Mix and cook until you start to see the oil separating from the paste (approx 3-5 min). Add chicken (or protein of choice) stirring to coat. 

4. Cook protein until almost cooked through (approx 10-15 min) and it begins to release its own water. Add yogurt and mix. Add water to desired thickness. Add diced potato and allow to simmer until potato is cooked through. 

5. Serve with rice, yogurt, and/or nann. 


**Variations**
----
1. Omit water and add thawed, chopped frozen spinch to make a palak dish. Mix and heat through, adding splashes of water if necessary. Allow to simmer a few minutes and garnish with chopped cilantro. 

2. To make a chickpea (channa) dish, cut the spices by approx 1/3 to 1/2, omit the yogurt, and add 2 cans of chickpeas after you see the oil separating from the tomato paste. Add water to desired thickness, throw in 1 chopped tomato and allow to simmer a few minutes to mix the flavors. Garnish with cilantro and serve. 

3. To make vegetarian, you can also substitute paneer instead of meat.
