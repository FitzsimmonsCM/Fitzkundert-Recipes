Notes: This is similar to garden vegetable soup, but here we're swapping sausage and tomatoes. 

Ingredients:
----
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 3 oz carrots, peeled and small diced
- 4 oz kale, cleaned and de-stemmed
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 9 oz chicken sausage
- 1 Tbsp Italian blend seasoning
- 2.5 oz Israeli couscous
- chicken stock concentrate
- Parmesan cheese, grated (to garnish)
- Cibatta or baguette (to garnish)


Directions:
----
1. In a large pot over medium heat, remove sausage from casing (if applicable) and brown approx 4-6 min

2. Add drizzle of olive oil and cook carrot, onion, and kale, stirring occasionally, until veggies are just softened and sausage finishes cooking, approx 5-7 min. Season with a big pinch of salt. 

3. Add garlic and Italian seasoning and cook 30-60 sec until fragrant. Then add stock concentrate, couscous, and 3.5 cups of warm water, scrapping bottom of pot to incorporate any sausage residue. Bring to boil and then reduce to simmer and cook until couscous is al dente, approx 8-9 min. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

4. Divide soup between bowls. Garnish with Parmesan cheese. Serve with toasted cibatta or baguette wedge.
