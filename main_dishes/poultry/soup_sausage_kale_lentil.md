This meal can be made ahead and frozen as a dump meal for a slow cooker. 

**Ingredients**
----

Prepare and freeze ahead:

- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 12 ounces cooked andouille-style chicken sausage, such as Aidells, cut into 1-inch pieces (see notes)

Fresh ingredients:

- 2 cups dried French lentils, also known as lentils du Puy (see notes)
- 3 cups chopped kale leaves (see notes)

**Directions**
----

1. Prepare fresh or thaw overnight from freezer. 

2. Add ingredients to slow cooker and cook on low for 7-8 hr or until lentils are tender, stirring occasionally. 


**Notes**
----

1. Whole Foods generally carries French Lentils. This is the preferred lentil style, as it holds it shape during slow cooking. Other lentils will turn to mush. Additionally, lentils can be frozen, or you can add them fresh. 

2. We recommend doubling the amount of andouille sausage. 

3. Note, not all kale may fit right away. Stir more frequently in the beginning as the Kale wilts, until greens are completely covered by the broth. 

4. We made this as a postpartum dump meal and it was delicious and perfect for autumn.
