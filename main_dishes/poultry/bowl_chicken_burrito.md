**Directions**

1.  Wash and fully dry cauliflower. Chop into large pieces, discarding leaves. Pulse in food processor until it has the texture of rice, working in batches if necessary. Do NOT over process, or it will turn to mush. 

2.  In a large skillet, heat 1 tsp olive oil on medium heat. Add scallion greens and cauliflower and saute until heated, approx 2-4 min. Season with salt, pepper, and squeeze of lime juice. (This step is not necessary, but it helps remove some of the bitter taste of raw cauliflower.)

3. Combine all seasoning ingredients. Reserve 1.5 tsp seasoning for the peppers. 

4. In a medium bowl, combine 1 Tbsp olive oil, chopped cilantro, lime juice, mustard, and 5 Tbsp seasoning mix. Mix to combine. Reserve 1 Tbsp of marinade for garnishing cooked chicken. Pour remaining marindate into large ziplock bag along with chicken slices. Marinate 15-30 min. 

5. While chicken is marinating, prepare veggies. Heat oil in skillet over med-high heat. Add onions and cook for approx 5 min or until soft. Add peppers and sprinkle with reserved chicken seasoning. Cook for 5-7 min. Remove from heat and set aside. 

6.  Melt remaining oil in the same skillet used for veggies. Brown chicken 5-6 min or until cooked through. Add reserved marinade and cook for additional 30 seconds or until fragrant. Remove from heat. 

7. Serve over cauliflower rice and garnish with lime wedge and sliced avocado.
