Author’s note: This recipe can be altered and changed in a multitude of ways. Adobo is also a very contentious filipino dish with everyone thinking their grandma/lola’s is the best (but mine is). 

**Ingredients**
- 4 lbs chicken (thighs, breasts, with skin or not, whatever works for you. Can also substitute pork).
- 1 cup white Vinegar
- 1 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 4-6 cloves garlic, crushed (or more to your taste)
- 2 to 4 bay leaves
- whole black peppercorns, to your taste

**Instructions**

1. Peel and crush your garlic cloves. 

2. In a large stockpot/dutch oven/soup pot put your meat in. Optional, if your meat has a skin or if you want a crust, you can brown your meat at this step in some neutral oil. 

3. Create the adobo sauce. For 4lbs of chicken I did about 1 cup of soy sauce + 1 cup white vinegar. Pour the adobo sauce over the meat. Add water to cover the meat completely. It is better to add too much water than too little. Water can always be cooked off later but you don’t want the meat getting dry. 

4. Add in the crushed garlic, and 2-4 bay leaves and a couple of black peppercorns. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer, then cover with a lid. 

5. Cook until the meat is fully cooked through, I’d say at least 45 min-1 hour. The longer you let it simmer the more tender it gets. If the sauce is too watery, uncover and simmer to let the sauce thicken. 

Serve over white rice with a side of veggies (my favorite is bok choy)
