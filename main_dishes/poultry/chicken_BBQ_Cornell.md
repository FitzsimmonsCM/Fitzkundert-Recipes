=====

Time = 10 min prep + 2 hr marinade + 30 min cook \
Servings = 6-8 servings \
From = Barbara Bozon and [My Town](http://mytownagreatplacetolive.com/cornell-chicken/)

**Ingredients**
----

- 2 whole chickens,  2 1/2 to 3 pounds each (cut in half or quarters )
- 2 cups cider vinegar
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1-2 Tbsp salt
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 Tbsp poultry seasoning


**Directions**
----
1. Combine the sauce ingredients in a blender and blend until fully emulsified and creamy. Place the chicken pieces in a large zip-locking type plastic bag or in a large bowl and pour in 3/4 of the sauce. Reserve 1/4 of the sauce for basting. Seal the bag or bowl and refrigerate until ready to grill.

2. Refrigerate for 2 -24 hours. Remove the chicken from the container and discard the marinade sauce.

3. Grill over charcoal, about 20-30 mins per side. Turn often, basting liberally with the reserved sauce every 5-10 minutes, until meat thermometer reads 165 degrees. Be careful not to let chicken burn. (Keeping a spray water bottle close by helps if the flames get out of hand). Grilling over charcoal or a gas grill, I chose charcoal because, in my opinion, it really enhances that distinct BBQ flavor of the incredible vinegar based marinated chicken.

**Notes**
-----

- Goes well with [salt potatoes](https://github.com/FitzsimmonsCM/Fitzkundert-Recipes/blob/main/main_dishes/veggie/salt_potatoes.md) and baked beans!
