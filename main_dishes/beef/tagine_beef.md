**Ingredients**
- 10 oz ground beef (90/10 or 85/15)
- 4 dates, chopped
- 4 prunes, chopped
- 6 almonds, rough chopped
- 1-2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 carrot, diced
- 1 red onion, diced
- 1 cup couscous (regular or israeli)
- 2 tsp ras el hanout spice 
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1 cup beef stock
- 1 Tbsp honey
- salt and pepper to taste

**Directions**

1. Cook couscous (regular or Israeli) according to package instructions. Drain excess water if necessary, fluff with fork and set aside. 

2. Add almonds to dry skillet. Roast 1-3 min or until almonds are fragrant, stirring to prevent burning. Transfer toasted almonds to a small bowl. 

3. In medium pot, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add carrot, onion, and garlic. Cook 4-5 min or until vegetables are softened. Season with salt and pepper. 

4. Add beef to the carrot/onion mixture. Cook 4-6 min, breaking meat apart. Season with salt and pepper. 

5. Add ras el hanout. Cook for 30-60 seconds or until fragrant. Add tomato paste and cook additional 30-60 seconds. 

6. Stir in dates, prunes, cinnamon stick, honey, beef stock, and 2 cups of water (1 can of water). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Simmer 3-5 min (longer is ok) or until volume is slightly thickened. Remove from heat. 

7. Divide couscous between bowls, and top with beef stew. Garnish with almonds and serve. 

**Notes**

1. Regular couscous makes this a more bowl-like dish, while the slightly larger size of Israeli couscous makes it eat more like a stew.

2. This recipe doubles well and can be reheated in a saucepot.
