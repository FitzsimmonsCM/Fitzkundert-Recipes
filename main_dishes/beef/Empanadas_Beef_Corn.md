Corn Filling

- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 3 cups fresh corn kernels (about 4–5 cobs) or frozen corn (thawed). A mix of whole kernel and cream-style canned corn works too.

**Directions**
----
1. Make the dough:

- In a bowl, mix flour and salt. Rub in butter/fat until crumbly.
- Add warm water little by little, mixing until dough forms. 
- Knead briefly until smooth. Wrap and rest at room temp for 30 min. 

2. Cook the filling:

- Heat oil/fat in a large pan over medium heat.
- Add onion (and bell pepper if using), cook until softened (5–6 min).
- Add ground beef, break apart with a spoon, cook until browned.
- Stir in sweet paprika, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, pepper. ○ Add tomato paste, cook 2 min, then add broth. Simmer until liquid reduces (about 5–7 min). ○ Remove from heat, cool completely. ○ Once cool, mix in chopped eggs and olives. 


3. Assemble:

- Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C)
- Roll dough to ~5–6 inch circles (or use the store-bought discs).
- Place 2 tbsp filling in the center. Moisten edges with water, fold over, and crimp with a fork or repulgue twist. (Empanadas can be frozen at this point, in an airtight container or bag, and baked later)
- Place on parchment-lined tray, brush with beaten egg.
- Bake 20–25 min until golden.
