Total Time = 15 min prep + 6.5 hr cook \
Servings = 6 people  

**Ingredients**
-  1 lb lean ground beef OR ground turkey (does not need to be browned)
-  1.5 cups cooked brown rice OR quinoa
-  1.5 cups shredded mild or medium cheddar cheese, divided (can substitute colby jack)
-  6 bell peppers, tops cut off and deseeded (save the tops)
-  1 15 oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
-  1 cup frozen corn kernels
-  1 cup mild or medium salsa
-  1 Tbsp cumin powder
-  1/2 tsp chili powder
-  salt and pepper (to your taste)
-  sour cream (optional garnish)


**Directions**

1. In a large bowl, combine meat, rice, 1 cup cheese, black beans, corn, salsa, and spices. Spoon the filling into each bell pepper cavity.

2. Place peppers into the slow cooker. Cover each pepper with the top portion that you cut off (makes a little lid). Cook on low heat for 5-6 hours until the peppers are tender and the meat is cooked through. 

3. Uncover peppers and top with remaining cheese. Cover and cook on low power for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese has melted. 

4. Serve immediately. Drizzle with sour cream if desired.


**To adapt this recipe for the oven**

1. Brown the meat in a skillet, once cooked, drain any excess fat. 

2. Return meat to skillet, and add beans, corn, salsa, rice, cheese, and spices. Allow liquid to reduce slightly (3-5 min)

3. Place peppers in a baking dish, cut side up. Spoon meat mixture into each pepper and the top of the pepper. 

4. Cover the entire baking dish with foil and bake 25-35 min at 400F or until peppers are tender. 

5. Remove foil and remove cut tops of peppers. Sprinkle cheese onto peppers and return to over. Cook until cheese is melted and slightly brown (4-6 min)


**Notes**

- Enjoy! This is a very flexible dish and if you don't have something, it is ok to substitute and experiment with different flavors or toppings.
