**Ingredients**

- 2 lbs 90/10 ground beef (80/20 is too fatty for this recipe)
- 1 medium yellow onion, grated and liquid drained (see notes)
- 6 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
- 2 large eggs
- 1/3 cup minced flat-leaf parsley + more to garnish
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs (preferred over normal breadcrumbs to keep meatballs tender)
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp fresh cracked black pepper
- 2 cups Tzatziki sauce (for serving)


**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 400F with rack in center position. Line 2 large sheet pans with parchment paper. 

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine beef, onion, garlic, eggs, parsley, breadcrumbs, and spices. Mix well and then with wet hands, roll into golfball size balls (approx 2 Tbsp / 30 g each). You should have approx 30 meatballs. 

3. Place meatballs on parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake for approx 20 minutes, rotating halfway through, until meatballs are golden and cooked through. 

4. Garnish with parsley. Serve warm, with tzatziki sauce for dipping. Alternatively, to make a meal, see serving ideas below. 

**Serving Ideas**

3. Wrap in pita bread with onions, cucumber, tomatoes and hummus

2. Keep a bowl of water nearby as your roll meatballs. Wet hands keeps the meat from sticking to you. Using a cookie scoop will also help meatballs stay the same size. 

3. To freeze meatballs: Bake the meatballs, and let them cool. Freeze on a cookie sheet so they freeze quickly and completely. Once frozen, place them in a labeled freezer bag and store for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat them, preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the center position. Arrange frozen meatballs on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and bake for 20 minutes, rotating halfway through.
