Ingredients
===========
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 120 grams (1 cup) plain breadcrumbs
- 20 grams salt and vinegar potato chips, not kettle cooked or thick cut
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 2 tsp dried parsley
- 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 70 grams (2/3 cup) all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
- 2 tbsp olive oil, divided 
- 1 cup red sauce, divided, recipe follows
- 2 oz low-moisture mozzarella, shredded
- 2 oz Italian fontina, shredded
- Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnishing 

Red Sauce:
- 8 cloves garlic
- 2 tsp kosher salt 
- 1/4 cup plus 1/2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 4 anchovy filets
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes 
- 2 28 oz cans peeled whole San Marzano tomatoes, drained
- 2-inch Parmesan rind 

Special equipment:
- 3 baking sheets with wire racks
- 9-by-13-inch oven-proof baking dish
- mortar and pestle

Directions
==========
1. Butterfly the chicken breasts and pound them to about 1/8" thick.

2. Cut the chicken breasts into 6 to 8 even pieces. Season with the salt on 
   both sides and place on a rack set inside a sheet pan. Cover and refrigerate 
   for 30 minutes.

3. Combine the breadcrumbs, potato chips, oregano, parsley and garlic powder in 
   a gallon zip-top bag and crush into a course meal.

4. Set up a breading station with three loaf pans: place the flour in the first 
   pan, the beaten eggs in the second, and the breadcrumb mixture in the third. 
   Set a clean wire rack inside a sheet pan to hold the breaded pieces.

5. Unwrap the chicken and blot well with paper towels then dredge the chicken 
   first in the flour (shake off the excess), then dip in the beaten eggs 
   (again, drain the excess), and finally coat with the breadcrumbs before 
   placing on the rack. 

6. Position an oven rack in the top third of the oven and crank the broiler to 
   high. Line a clean pan with paper towels and have it standing by. 

7. Melt 2 tbsp of the butter with 1 tbsp of the olive oil in an 11-inch sauté 
   pan over medium heat. When the butter foams, add half the breaded chicken to 
   the pan, but don’t overcrowd. Cook, undisturbed, until crisp and golden 
   brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the clean rack, wipe out the 
   pan and repeat with the remaining butter, oil and chicken. 

8. Spread 3/4 cup of the red sauce into the bottom of a a 9-by-13-inch 
   oven-proof glass baking dish or metal pan and broil until the sauce bubbles 
   and begins to caramelize, no more than 2 minutes (see Cook's Note).

9. Remove the dish from the oven and arrange the chicken pieces in a single 
   layer. Dot the chicken with the remaining red sauce, leaving bare spots to 
   retain some crispy bits. Scatter the fontina and mozzarella over the sauce.

10. Return to the broiler until the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 
    about 1 minute. 

11. Garnish with chopped flat-leaf parsley. 

Red Sauce:

1. Work the garlic, salt and 1/2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil together with a 
   mortar and pestle until a paste forms.

2. Heat the remaining 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil in a medium saucepan over 
   medium heat. Add the garlic paste and cook, stirring, until it begins to 
   brown, about 2 minutes. 

3. Add the anchovies and the red pepper flakes and cook until the anchovies 
   begin to break down, about 1 minute. (I usually use the back of a wooden 
   spoon to crush the anchovies.)

4. Add the tomatoes and break them up with the back of the spoon then submerge 
   the Parmesan rind in the sauce. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, 
   until the sauce is almost dry, about 1 hour. 

5. Discard the Parmesan rind or feed it to the dog. Use the sauce immediately 
   or store in an airtight container in the fridge. (See Cook's Note.)
