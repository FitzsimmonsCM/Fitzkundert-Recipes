[Ingredients]
- 1 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/2 tsp garlic, minced
- ginger (about 1 thumb length, peeled and diced)
- 4 (6 oz) pacific salmon fillets, skin on
- 2 Tbsp sesame seeds
- jasmine rice (garnish)
- green vegetable (bok choy, broccoli, asparagus, or similar) (garnish)

[Directions]

1. Preheat oven to 450F

2. In a small saucepan, mix soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger. Stir over medium heat until glaze is reduced by 1/3 (approx 7-10 min). 

3. Reserve 3 Tbsp glaze in small bowl. Pour remainder of glaze into shallow baking dish. Place salmon in, skin side up, and let stand for 15 min. Turn salmon over (skin side down) prior to baking. While salmon is basting, begin rice. 

4. Bake until salmon is opaque on the edges but translucent in the center (approx 15 min). 

5. Remove salmon and increase heat to broil. Brush salmon with half of the reserved glaze and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Broil until seeds are toasted and salmon is mostly opaque, but still moist in the center (approx 2 min). 

6. Drizzle salmon with remaining glaze and transfer to plate with fish spatula. Serve with rice and green vegetable.
