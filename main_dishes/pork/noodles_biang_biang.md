**Noodle Ingredients**

-  375 g AP flour
-  200 mL water
-  1/2 tsp salt
-  oil for greasing

**Sauce  Ingredients**

-  chili oil (garnish)
-  200 mL peanut oil
-  4 Tbsp soy sauce
-  3 Tbsp chili flakes
-  1.5 Tbsp white vinegar
-  3 cloves garlic, fine dice
-  3 scallions, greens and whites separated, fine chop
-  1/2 tsp cumin
-  3 tsp sesame seeds, toasted
-  100 g pork mince (optional, to add protein)
-  1/2 cup noodle cooking water (reserved)


**Directions**

1.  Mix the flour, water and salt together until shaggy in texture. Knead until smooth and elastic (approx 5 minutes in a mixer with a dough hook). 

2. Shape the dough into a round and cut into 8 even pieces. Shape them into a small cucumber or potato shape and coat in oil. Cover and rest at room temperature for 3 hours (to allow the dough to relax).

3. Put a large pot of water to boil. 

4. While water boils, make the sauce. Add all ingredients in a small saucepan. If you're not using pork just heat for 1-2 minutes or until combined. If you are using pork, heat until pork is cooked through. Keep the lid on to keep warm and set aside. 

5. On a greased surface with a greased rolling pin, roll out the dough. Each piece should be approx 2.5-3 inches wide and slightly longer than the rolling pin. Once rolled out, firmly press the rolling pin against the center vertically to leave a depression in the dough. 

6.  Oil your hands lightly and then gently pull dough apart using the depression as a opening. It will stretch open with little prompting. Stretch it out so that it is thin, like a ribbon and a very, very long belt. 

7. Place dough ribbons directly into the water and cook for 1 minute or until it rises to the surface. Place noodles in a bowl (this makes enough for two bowls). When all the noodles are cooked, pour the hot chili oil over it.

8. Garnish with sauce and serve
