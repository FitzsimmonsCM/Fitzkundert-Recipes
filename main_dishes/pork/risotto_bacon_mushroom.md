**Ingredients**
----

- 2 scallions, thin sliced, separate whites and greens
- 2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
- 4 oz bacon
- 0.5 oz vidalia onion paste
- 1.5 Tbsp sour cream
- 1 oz cheese roux concentrate
- 4 oz button mushroom, washed and sliced
- 3 Tbsp parmesan, grated
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 8 oz chicken stock (or sub chicken stock concentrate)
- 3/4 cup arborio rice
- unsalted butter
- salt and pepper (to your taste)


**Directions**
----

1. Preheat oven to 425ÂºF with rack in top position. Boil 1.5 L of water and keep warm. 

2. Toss sliced mushrooms with drizzle of oil and season with salt, pepper, and 1/2 tsp thyme. Place on 1 side of foil-lined baking sheet. Place bacon pieces on the other side. Cook 15-20 min or until bacon is cooked and mushrooms are tender. Transfer bacon to paper-towel-lined plate to blot excess grease. When cooled, rough chop the bacon. 

3. While bacon cooks, add drizzle of olive oil to large pan. Cook scallion whites for 1 min or until fragrant. 

4. Add garlic, rice, onion paste, and 1 Tbsp butter. Cook 1-2 min or until rice is translucent and garlic is fragrant. 

5. Add 1/2 cup simmering water and stock concentrate to the pan with the rice. Stir until liquid is mostly absorbed. Continue adding liquid 1/2 cup at a time until liquid has absorbed, rice is al dente, and risotto is creamy, approx 20-25 min. 

6. When rice is al dente, add cheese roux, sour cream, and 1 Tbsp butter. Stir in mushrooms and half of the chopped bacon, and half the Parmesan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

7. Divide between bowls and garnish with scallion greens, chopped bacon, and remaining Parmesan. 

**Notes**
----

1. This tastes like the potato skin appetizer you might find at a bar. 

2. Watch bacon to make sure it doesn't overcook in the oven.
