**[Ingredients]**

- 1 shallot, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- chicken stock concentrate
- 1 lemon, quartered and de-seeded
- 4 oz green peas
- 9 oz pork sausage, remove casing
- 3/4 cup Arborio rice
- 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, shredded
- salt and pepper to taste
- unsalted butter

- skillet
- kettle or medium pot of simmering water

**[Directions]**

1. Bring pot of water (at least 6 cups) to a boil and then reduce to simmer and keep on the side. If using a faster electric kettle, water can be boiled during step 4. 

2. Remove sausage from casing. Brown sausage in skillet, breaking apart larger chunks, approx 5-7 min. Use a slotted spoon to transfer sausage to paper-towel-lined plate, retaining oil in the pan for the next step.

3. In a large skillet, saute shallot over medium heat until lightly browned, approx 3-4 min. Season with salt and pepper. 

4. Add rice, 1 cup of boiling water, and corresponding amount of stock concentrate. Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has mostly absorbed. Repeat with remaining water, adding it 1/2 cup at a time and stirring until liquid has absorbed and rice is al dente, approx 25-30 min. 

5. Once risotto is done, stir in sausage, peas, half of the Parmesan, 1 Tbsp butter, and squeeze of lemon juice. Taste and season with salt and pepper. 

6. Divide between bowls. Garnish with remaining Parmesan, and lemon zest. Serve with lemon wedge. 

**[Notes]**

- Recipe doubles well if you need to serve more people.
- If you would prefer a more rustic look for the sausage, place sausage links in a skillet in water. Bring slowly to a simmer and cook for approx 10-12 min, covered. Uncover, and allow water to evaporate, turning frequently until browned. Internal temperature should register 160F. Slice into coins prior to serving and garnish risotto.
